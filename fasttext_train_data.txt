spoke with  glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting the concept is that a deal flows into a website that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped if it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund bill track etc  could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim lets review presentation then discuss with  and  d  and proceed to banks  is clearing idea with  we are shooting for a friday 23 meetingthanks

they mitigated the shit out of prices our pepperhill project was dispatched at 300mwh the whole day
i want the tickets also can you tell me what time the race starts on sunday
yes  although probably more useful if we have a smoking gun in the legislative arena  doe has no authority over tva
this isnt the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp  i thought i sent  an email over the weekend  the language needs to say that  has advised that it is willing to treat ubs as an affiliate   we cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing  as this would take agreement of our partners
it will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis  it is probably sufficient to communicate with the credit department under   for wholesale and the ews services group under  hughes for retaili spoke with  hughes and he is going to have csc run a report of the tariff obligations  he will send the info to me and ill forward to amr thanks
be happy to spend some time with them am around all weekend if need be
thanks for the feedback  your model now assumes a modification to the distribution tariff to include a new rate element  that may get around the settlement although oca in pa will think that now d is going up and there is no offset in the g rate so consumers are getting screwed because they wont switch  also can the papuc implement this charge and direct the edcs to transfer the funds to thirdparty generators  seems like that would require legislative changes  i like the idea that there should be fixed charge for icap  one way to get that number would be to go back to the edc stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony  remember if they are earning more from the market than that  amount they are overearning on their stranded costs
hi there can you do me a favor and get me the home cell and work numbers of the following people in canadamilly  keohane  ledain  daviesthanks bt

i believe what   was referring to is the termination of tws shared cost surcharge effective october 31 2001  i dont think there would be any system changes required  typically tws rates are entered with a start and end date and if this is correct the surcharge should have an end date of 10312001 and there wouldnt be anything else to do  if its not entered that way an end date could be entered now whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level  the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts and that should take care of it  is this correct  i know youre on a project please let me know if you can check this or who canthank you

i guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack  i have to admit that i wasnt looking forward to it since i didnt know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy  about 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool  she kept asking are you ok and almost seemed to sympathize with me  she said she didnt say anything to dax and would never say anything to him  she was so cool about it i was totally shocked  so on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them  i walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised    after we had been there for a while z laura devon and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table  so starts saying so you arent going to email me anymore and acting all sad  then she said i didnt have any balls  later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the antiheisman and motions as if to open her legs  it was funny as shit  she also said she dumped dale but i dont know that i completely buy that  anyway all together it was very interesting weekend  i dont know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous

it is my understanding that five aep employees will in s offices starting may 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the hpl trading and to direct the hpl bidweek activities for june assuming close occurs for june  to protect s proprietary trading information for may and june i would like the aep employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 1030 am for the duration of their stay  from 730  1030 am is when the may business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with hpl employeesanother issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur june 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until july  who wears the risk positions  my suggestion is that if aep is going to set up hpl activities for june then they should wear the risk positions  the way to accomplish this is to do the following1  the initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index      point ie hsc or waha after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections2  volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400000d purchased on ifgmr hsc index related pricing will be sold to aep in the ground at june index       actual storage costs  volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to bammel storagecase 1core term index position    100000d long  50000d waha 50000d texomathirty day index position    200000d long  volumes at thompsonville and total index position           300000d longvols targeted for storage   200000d sells aep 200000d in storage at june ifgmr hsc index plus storage costs  any additional volumes would be sold to aep at july index   sells 50000d gas daily swap at ifgmr waha and 50000d gas daily swap at ifgmr hsccase 2core term index position     200000 short 50000d waha 150000d hscthirty day index position     400000 long   50000d waha 100000d agua  100000d thompsonville 150000d total index position

governor wants to cut costs of power tough sell for  as suppliers balk by  geissingersacramento bureau sacramento  with an economic perfect storm and an election looming gov gray  wants to renegotiate several of the states expensive longterm power contracts  a move that could translate into a big break for californians but the generators who signed the multibilliondollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state if the politicians were to make all these contracts go away  who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any new contracts asked  cartwright president of san based calpine corp a major supplier of california power and many experts and analysts are skeptical about  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state which in turn supplies california customers through various utilities good luck former republican gov   sarcastically declared upon hearing of the democratic governors plan  however has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly powersupply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit the outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years perhaps decades this could save billions of dollars said  heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights one of the consumer groups that has embraced  power contract renegotiation plan  goode  legal affairs secretary said the administration is not targeting every contract because the pacts have been extremely valuable in keeping the market stable the governors aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies whose contracts dont require them to reopen negotiations with the state the governor signed more than 50 longterm contracts  worth more than 40 billion  with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year the state made shortterm purchases to supply california after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities then entered the longerterm pacts that provide about a third of the states power demands the contracts range in duration from a few months to 20

your welcome what was the name of the dude ranch you described
i have reviewed the la plata facilities oo agreement  lee could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment  it appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the followingspecial services  this would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the operator tw and the operating committee tw  nwplrepresentatives  if nwpl agreed their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest  if we did obtain their approval future om cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners  weve agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 35 escalator starting in 2001 addition or expansion  demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity we have to give notice to nwpl and they have 60 days to participate  if they participate they share in the cost at their ownership interest but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest  if they dont indicate a desire to participate in 60 days we can proceed with the expansion without any approval but also no cost sharing  also any incremental om associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansioni think if we went the special services route we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels  i think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost  they probably dont have 260000 15mm  174 sitting around in a budget somewhere that theyd like to fork over for these facilities   what do you think  how difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilitiesrecommendation  to save us the 60 days notice period of an expansion i think we should notify them that its a necessary special service and ask for approval  to pass along their share of the cost but to be prepared to eat 100 of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities  in this event we would need to agree

perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the  estate that i believe has a lot of merit  as you may know one of our business goals within  net works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services  with the money and talent that has been poured into s trading operations systems and processes we believed that there could be market demand for these services  ironically enough we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on december 1  understandably the customer became concerned during november and the deal was shelved  our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services coupling our systems and our people but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed  that was offering these services  the market place didnt want us to win again as  obviously the world has changed  while effort is currently focused on the formation of netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within egm eim ea ees etc i think that we would shortchange the estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the estate  the idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm which could provide some capital additional resource pool and a ready sales channel  with the potential of spinoff companies from  and with former  employees taking jobs with other firms many doors would be opened for this independent services company to provide services  servicing the  estate could be the first engagement for this services company  depending upon the structure of the deal benefits to the  estate could be reduced costs for systems and services perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the commoditylogic tools  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements etc  another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals this would create a true career opportunity  a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm  making it much more likely that these people could be retained  and i met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept

see story belowstate completes historys largest municipalbond sale californias treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in us history tuesday  a 57 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the states energy crisis the sale  coming in an environment of recordlow interest rates  also proved to be the cheapest such shortterm financing by the state on record and it provided a backdrop for a warning from state treasurer  angelides that continued delay in the longawaited 125 billion energybond sale could wreak havoc with the states budget in the next fiscal year with the sept 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins july 1 2002 the slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis could force draconian budget cuts angelides said we were already facing tough budget times in 20022003 he said and that was before the tragedy of sept 11 now if falling revenues are added to the 6 billion hole well have deficits akin to the early 1990s angelides said noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services earlier this year the state advanced 62 billion in generalfund money to buy wholesale power for customers of pacific gas and electric co southern california  and san  gas  electric co repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the 125 billion in energy bonds  a transaction angelides said requires key approvals from the state public utilities commission the huge energybond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late october or early november but the plan before the puc has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities with utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks puc president  lynch said tuesday this year weve been taken to court probably five times more than weve been taken to court last year partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because its been trying to make them so fast she said but angelides said that given

on wednesday we will be having a mini trading track interview session  the quality may not resemble the first session we had but i thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program  we will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join  i had a couple of observations from last time1  i think we were too hard on external candidates  there are 5 or 6 external candidates  remember that they dont have the  grounding that the internal candidates have  most of them are not in the gas or electricity industry  try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities2  some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo  that doesnt mean that they will not be good traders one day i think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow

im still concerned about the terms price and quotation  my understanding was that worldscale is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price  that is what it looks like in the baltic exchange limited publication  i havent seen the iitra publication so cant comment on how their quotations are denominated  the problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description the floating price is defined to be the index  therefore the index must be a currency denominated number  that is why in the us version i used the average of the prices calculated using the worldscale assessments  do i have this all wrong

kelleygiven our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for december so we have no trades to report this month  hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future  for whatever it is worth it that there are some unusual things happening in the fixed float markets in texas particularily at hsc  the nymex is down 10 cents today yet the hsc fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or 2336 to 2345 yesterday to now 236 with the  hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of 231 again in a falling market  we feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and gas daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially  i have no evidence since i was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all i am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index considerationthank you

our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger  such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between  affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of thirdparty agreements  a merger by ena or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ena might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex
thanks for the note these events arent cheap so it is nice to know they are worth while to some rick
a few thoughtsconference calls on issues of this size dont generally seem very constructive and id suggest that we push for a facetoface with if the legislature doesnt get the mou out well in advance of september 14th  wont be focused and id suggest that we try and rescheduleno matter the forum the proposal will be tough to get through even though it makes alot of economic sense  its a big change and big changes dont come easy no matter the benefits  that said no shots no ducks  we ought to make a pushthe proposal may not be contingent on legislation it might be possible to make it happen at the california pucassignment to dwr would be significant and might require legislation need to ask a qf lawyerthe proposal makes sense for both the ious and dwr since both want as much headroom as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirementsgiven the pending rate agreement between the ca puc and dwr and the utilities messedup financial position dwr is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspectiveall that said none of the above matters much unless the utility a critical mass of qfs and the pucs consumer advocate ora buy into the ideaid propose that we continue with  if  bites then go jointly with  to persuade the qfs if the qfs bite then go jointly with  and qf to try to persuade oraon the issue of sleeving through the iou or dwr it seems useful to remain flexible on that though absent general support from the ious qfs and ora the entity will be academicsome preliminary thoughts  happy to discuss furtherbest

 i was talking to  etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the cfo  craver i understand that you guys were dealing with  fielder   for sure we want to know what they are up to  i think like all deals in california we are going to run into issues with credit and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty  is it edison or dwr  it is very important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan  do you know the cfo   regards bt

we will be running a december mtd dpr tomorrow  before we start this process please recalc the east west eastbank  westbank portfolios to adhoc  check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the east and west portfoliosbefore kicking off the calcs double check the specific deals that are listed on the physical power terminated spreadsheet  i believe there were whole deals moved to the bank portfolios by  that should never have been moved because they were already liquidated in november  also i have attached a new copy of the physical terminations  there is one counterparty txu added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs  in addition to adjusting deal entry for txu we also need to adjust schedulingbefore recalcing the bank portfolios please contact  brackett or  mcginnis 42022 to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolioswe should still be calcing on no trueup  casey i know you said this probably will still cause us trouble  at this point we are going for reasonableness with numbers  all the previous toplevels in our rolls as of the 3rd or 4th will stay as toplevels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power  the remaining prior day values will be held in schedule e for georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account  these top levels should match the total value of your bankruptcy portfolios  where i think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations  these numbers will also have to moved to schedule ewhen running through liquidations in the east and west portfolios we will not be flat  currently we are liquidating all nonterminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling  thresa and i are working on this with corry and   the settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the checkout and ultimately the cleanup processtomorrow should be a blast  i cant wait

an issue has come up that i did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for june should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not  physical deals for june have started to happen already  if close does occur and all the deals prior to may 18th are done as hpl then ena will miss out on a lot of potential business for june  so i believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to hpl ie agua  thompsonville oasis  lonestar  texoma be done as hpl deals in a location such as  tailgate that is relevant to hpl and ena will be split evenly hpl and ena and written up as two separate purchases  waha is not considered here since aep already has a waha trader who is active in the marketthanks

jodyi have not confirmed that these are the correct values but this should get you started  these are based on socals published longterm storage tariff  i cannot confirm whether socal has capacity at these rates available to sell  keep in mind i dont think the lng project would incur the entire cost of the storage as ena could extract additional value from optimizing its operation  it appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights which i do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter  please do not hesitate to call with any questions

hey nickii got back yesterday and am back at work although i hesitate to call it that  i had a good time back home went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks which felt ok  its been awhile since ive been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing  it feels good to be back too  i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again  cooperps my sisterinlaw really liked her sweater and it fit perfectly

thanks  sorry we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes  lots of time on budgets  still continuing this week  what i would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the doorstep team within a few days of their return from each review  my goal is to stay informed on an ongoing basis not quarterly or by bunching several of these together  if there are some concerns i need to know right away  executive management will assume that i am staying informed on a timely basis and that should be the reality  the is dont have to be dotted nor the ts crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting  it is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped will engage in a conversation with me  i want to be prepared so that i am knowledgeable about the key points from each review so that i can respond appropriately   thanks

me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the us the dollar should remain fairly strong  however if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be the turnaround will be very quick
 thanks  looks good  some thoughts for you to consider 1    not sure that impact 1 makes sense to present  no real reason to set ctc  0 ckwh on jan 5 calpx was still in operation  i think that impact 2 better captures the idea  also probably not good to use the term ctc eliminated  maybe should say ctc  0 ckwh  given the cpucs march 27 order the utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until march 31 2002 2     in calculating impact 2 what did you use as the jan 19  aug baseline  did you calculate the hit of 1045 from actual bills or based on our dj index model there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline  also i assume that the feb  aug timeframe was relatively low because ees and eemc had most of their load on bundled service 3    probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for px credit calculation and most specifically the pge adjustment  also may be interesting to have the  impact of the pge adjustment the rate adjustment to recapture their previous mistake  i think that this is something we need to go into the cpuc to fight pretty quickly 4    should impact 4 and impact 5 apply to sces loads  in column 4 it looks like it does  sce is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge 5    probably better to model impact 5 as of oct 1 not sept 1 6    can you break out the volumes for vintage contracts versus retail gen with passthru contracts  you havent shown anything for a utility undercollection costs or b cdwr bond fees  these costs may hit our vintage contracts

hi therethanks for the note  it is very weird for sure  i never thought it would happen to   one of the reasons i didnt go to a smaller shop even though i was offered more money was because i didnt want to deal with crap like this  lo and behold  life is strange  anyway at this point it looks like dynegy is the suitor for the big e  i think it will happen  the question will become where are we going to be located  fortunately i only have about 8 months left in my contract so i wont have to put up with too much crap for too long  well seeitaly is awesome  really really is  i realize it more and more since i came back  tuscany is so cool  if you go there go to san quirico montecino and montepulciano  very cool little towns and good wine   is very cool as well  i may go back there for a month or so this june if things arent to wacky  have a good time there im envioussounds like you are doing better  also sounds like work is fun and challenging  so do you think you are going to stay there for a while  do you miss the west  i dont think ill live east of the rockies but you never knowwell it looks like this year might be as interesting as last  i keep thinking things will mellow out a little but things keep getting more and more strangeit was great to hear from you and take care of yourself

we lost about 15 to layoffs and we lost about 40 to the estate staying with   the remaining people are going to ubs  we will see what happens  how are things with you  talk to you later
maybe we should meet  i am not sure what  has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change  my objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do  i told him that as he has time i could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job  the bottom line is that  is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading  i viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like  but i have no immediate plans to move  into trading  if the time ever comes that i would like bring him into trading i will certainly coordinate the transition with you  i was under the impression that  cleared all this with you before he moved  it appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than i intend at this time  how do you want to handle this
thanks   the dynegy folks took me to new york for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about s pipelines and about me coming over  the only problem is they never asked me if i was planning on going over  i know their ceo and coo very well so i will probably have a choice  i would like to see this thing through  i committed in my current contract to stay until 3105 so i would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless  i do feel an obligation to help right the ship  my businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now  employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical  either way i will be fine  thanks for your concern  it means alot

i agree with your arguments  the other problem with sces analysis is that they had a defined stranded cost amount and they deserve that money what california did my explaination is that sce was offered frozen rates for 4 years  all of the margin they earned was shareholders compensation for moving to direct access  if the total  of margin was 0 or less this implies simply that sce had no generation stranded costs the entire argument that sce is making forgets the billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate
heres a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with direct access please let  us know if the list looks about rightfyi   and i are scheduled to travel to portland to sit down with  swain  co in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risksfinally note that though the risks listed below are linked to puc actions the california legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks  for example the legislature could pass a bill directing the puc how to allocate costs associated with the utilties undercollection the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power dwrs long term contracts etc best  1retroactive suspension of da contracts  the puc rules in a subsequent decision that da is suspended on some date between july 1 and september 20th  2contract renewal forbidden  the puc includes contract renewal under the suspension of da3no incremental dasring  the puc includes incremental additions and subtractions of da customers load under the suspension of da eg fast food chains university campus4cost allocation the puc adds new costs to da accounts andor disproportionately shifts existing costs to da accounts  costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to da customers include iou undercollection bonds to repay the state general fund and dwr contracts  the costs associated with these categories are substantial additional suggestions from  day5dasr processing   if the utilities attempt to implement the commissionordered suspension in an onerous way it may put at risk contracts executed prior to 092001 but not yet dasrd6confidentiality of contract information  the utilities andor the puc may require esps to show contracts as proof that contracts were executed prior to 092001

your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english  i was wondering why you didnt respond  jury duty sucks huh  have you been going out at all
and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each  the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set  the schedule that we have been working with that  provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting  if you had set aside two hours that had not been communicated to us  there were only two onehour meeting slots on that schedule  one for enw from 12 and one for research from 34  i have a major conflict on friday  i committed months ago to attend a meeting that  lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours  only because  perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday i decided to skip out from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together  in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting i orchestrated the time swap with  kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 300  i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for  lay  maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us  i would appreciate your help on that scheduling issues aside  suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared  our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business  we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses  ees or ea  that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs  we are prepared however with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes  i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw  if you would like to cover all of enws budgets together both for ees and ea

 thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk  we will certainly name an appropriate person from operations to be involved in this project and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives  there doesnt appear to be anyone from ets on your distribution list  operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of s businesses  is the initial focus simply on the wholesale businesses or is there an intent to make this enterprisewide i suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this rac initiative complementing replacing overlapping or perhaps duplicating the work of eas aas internal audit engagement the critical self assessment process being piloted in london this year by the operations team in conjuction with the aa audits doorstep reviews current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams and our major initiatives for ees tracked every other thursday with you and  causey   before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas it might be constructive to cover this in a kickoff meeting with the addressees on your memo i might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project  the creation of a framework for quantifying enterprisewide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels  as on other policies devised by rac it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the tobedeveloped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unitfunctional area outside rac  the crossfunctional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to rac in creating the policy but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives finally the second bullet point in s list below is already being addressed through the project that you and i agreed upon in august to insure that information from all source systems to risktrac is complete accurate and efficiently handled as you and i discussed this is a global effort spanning all commoditiesall locationsall source systems   we have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely

 my marketer out of the portland office had word that a ees marketer   dickinson  was looking to contact a utility in the northwest the reason that ees was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and ees would help them create or structure this marketing effort is at the core of what ena  wholesale gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts utility business is a ena customer and i consider them a primary wholesale customeri have not discussed this is anyone at ees but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with ees on our behalfpls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from meregards

i called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 995  after 6 months the rate goes to 1295  they charged us for hbo showtime and cinemax which should be 1695 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we dont currently get cinemax  i went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package with cinemax and they are crediting us for 1995 for the overcharge  going forward the package will be 1695 or we can cancel cinemax and save 400 a month

fbi agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new  garage wednesday through friday this week 450  the spot is clearly marked reserved and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space   i have left a polite note on the intruding car on thursday and friday asking that the reserved status be observed as there are many unused nonreserved parking spaces in the garage  i have put up with this for 3 days  if the fbi will be back here next week however i will grow tired of this  is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the reserved parking spaces  i know that you have bigger issues at hand but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended that i will be paying for a reserved parking space that i never get to use  thanks

battle lines drawn over longterm power deals sd union tribune 100701in a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the california public utilities commission as the focus this time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs in a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business consumer advocates celebrated when the puc refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases but business leaders and the governor cheered the puc for approving a 33 billion rescue of southern california  which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout as massive as the  deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of sdge than the second reality that emerged last week despite the puc action on the contracts californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity or maybe not while electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals duress allegedconsumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind california to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need we should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said  ahern a senior analyst with consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine we did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation  shames executive

attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily  i made this extremely simple on our first pass but i left in the tabs that were in the oldcurrent file  all you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locationsyellow column  this will then set the gas daily curve  we will continue to true up to gas daily each day  you may want to also reset the next days curve as well since this is a hardcode you simply type over the previous days load  the phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it  we can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like  i figure you will want to keep your model and i can pull info from there as well  i simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs  please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it  thanks

i like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week  i like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables  plus  these seem a little bigger  i like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen  the kitchen should be bigger  you could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen
by the way i dont think i finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today  yes you are correct that pnr revenue was only 1200 in july  due to higher swings in the socal window causing higher line pack parks were not made available most of the month  tk continues to challenge our ability to accomodate pnrs  the daily balancing report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this servicethanks

 concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact transwestern if  should direct the liquids from their 8 line into the pipeline liquids tank at wt1 i have a concern  the liquids that are generated in the 8 line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations rcra as long as they stay in the  line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank  because wt1 is a mainline compressor station any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under subtitle c of rcra  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank  within the past few years we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at wt1 which were not placed there by tranwestern  chemicals which producers and processing upstream of wt1 have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal  unfortunately there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materialsbased upon this i would recommend that we not allow dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank
any idea where this stands

here are my thoughts 1agree that offering transmission provider waiver given rto status is premature2maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled provider of last resort type service and bundled utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition  at a minimum in places like pa where the utility sales service is a direct competitor there should be no difference with any competitive player  in a state like ga where the utility sales service is a monopoly by statue ie bundled retail i still think given the ability to cogenerate it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale  maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus  i fully agree to include these providers in the definition3 call  n to discuss examples of how native load exemption has caused problems weve put in earlier filings4the question of holding company etc  we should argue for an exemption5i am also troubled by the administer term  ferc should prohibit any helping by the transmission provider of anyone in the marketplace  maybe focus ferc on clarifying its positions6emergency sections  keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry and could be a real problem given a caiso type situation  ask  comnes for thoughts  probably dont object but want to make sure that if emergency develops there must a preset timeframe for going back to normal business7everything filed at the ferc related to standards of conduct should be posted on the oasisi didnt understand the final bullet point comments  is this policy or a statement of something to come

hi momthings are a little better here for me friday was a horrible day we had layoffs of about 30 of our office  lots of crying and sadness on the floor   the weekend was strange  came back from  un announced which was not what we agreed to and i got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to catch me doing something or having someone over  he is still really struggling with the idea that i just cant love him like a wife anymore and that is not enough to keep two people together  i wish that i could make this easier on him and i almost think that if i had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accepti am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt i do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents i wouldnt wish that on anyone just pray for him and for meschool sounds wonderful i am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones how fun  i love you

i finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options  unfortunately they are committed to paine webber for the foreseeable future  the two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with paine webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place  they are less concerned with the services that paine webber doesnt offer the employees such as lending against vested options  it was worth a try
had a great weekend and looking forward to next time   you made it back to town ok  i had no problems but i think you should just assume that from the newark airport its at least 25 hours probably a bit more  the  lady didnt bat an eye of course i stood towards the back of the car so she wasnt really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry  did the kids get away even close to on timethanks again

my other comments on the tariff sheets were as followssection 3522nd paragraph 3rd sentence  explanation of incremental revenue  when we talk about revenues which tw already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period  what if were taking bids on future capacity and were trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges were not necessarily being paid yet  the language is so specific  can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what tw already has contractually committed2nd paragraph last sentence  the phrase guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate  what does this mean  tk  i were both a littles confused by this language4th paragraph 4th sentence  the phrase the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline  tk is the phrase published indices generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes  i realize it will probably have to be something that is published

devises new borrowing plan his executive order could speed up 125 billion in bond sales and bypass puc oversight of repayment mechanism sacramento  gov gray  is crafting a new plan to expedite the longdelayed borrowing of 125 billion to repay the sagging california state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis the plan  which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week  would minimize the role of the states top power regulator the public utilities commission which enraged  last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan with enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two states largest utilities the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis that is one scenario  spokeswoman  mclean said wednesday when asked about the proposal there are a number of different scenarios being considered nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell 125 billion in revenue bonds most of which about 96 billion would go back into the state treasury the issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid  a critical step before they could be marketed to investors  wanted the puc to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers but the puc said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes the puc also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the controlled department of water resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue the puc which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority it rejected the  plan oct 2 on a 41 vote led by its president  appointee  lynch  earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market the plan now under review however would bypass that the dwr would not directly set rates but under the  plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming

a quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group i understand thenew plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one locationmy recommendation is against it if the objective of having two separate weathergroups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent viewsthe new seating arrangements will nullify it the power weather guys will defer to  who has unquestionable authority and experienceif we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groupsunder s leadershipplease let me know what you think

think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point  however think the failure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people  think that nobody wants to own above 325 only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 510 cents higher unless aga is very bullish

in case you hadnt seen it your pal vikrams taking some pretty hard knocks right about now   all is wellbestconsumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general  lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companieswe believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said  ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the  contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san  chronicle reported monday the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the states energy crisis to negotiate highpriced contracts according to the report the average price of power under the contracts is 69 a megawatthour more than double peak electricity prices last week budhraja disclosed in august that he owned as much as 10000 in scottish power stock while a 1 billion longterm contract with subsidiary pacificorp was being hammered out the state signed the 10year contract july 6 budraha sold his stock july 30 state officials say budhraja had nothing to do with the deal according to the report

i have asked and will let you know the answer later today    the bigger question is that they can not loan money to  and can only dividend so if they can do something to raise the cash they still cant get it out any more out than they can by dividending    the other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred and were advised to wait   their receivables from california are part of the problem   more update later

grigsi talked to lambie our resident produciton and reserve expert about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons apparently if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will water out either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays also it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well 100500 mmd in s opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in  this helps let me know if you learn anything further

the house we live in is about 1700 sq foot older home that needed some fixing up  at the time i thought we paid too much however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home  the  texans a very original name have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake  also they have totally redone south main blvd creating a nice thoroughfare the area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood  however home values go up and down just like the stock market  most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable therewhen we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare i think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job  i prefer to do it myself i like the way it looks when i do it and it is whole lot cheaper  one day the contractor almost died in the house he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of advil to ease the pain however he did this on an empty stomach  he had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week  he ended up returning and finishing the job  anyways i have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time i will have a better idea on how to get things done  it was hard to organize and quality assure the job since i had just started a demanding job here at   all in all i think france or us you run into the same types of problems with contractors  talking about wild flowers and plants the same is true for costa rica   plants that only grow indoors with great care in  grow like weeds in costa rica  i recommend that on your places to go list christmas feliz natal and feliz navidad

 i got the email last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for operations inclusive of power and gas logistics  the tabs total 184 with one associate noted on a separate line in power logistics and 183 without that associate so i dont know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the operations total taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change  456 reduction  at this moment i dont know how feasible that is  but i will work with   and  to find out we  need some questions answered first to go through this 1  who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for gas and power logistics  together those groups represent 25 of the 184 headcount  going in i would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions  should be 21 reductions  we need to know who we should work with to coordinate this  need names and weekend contact numbers 2  what will the overall headcount be for netco  what we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes  if commercial numbers dont change and the business scope doesnt change a 456 reduction is probably out of the question   3  is the 100 number for operations only a startup number  could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up approval is obtained for physical gas business etc  or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002 4  what are ubs expectations for mid and back office  what are the views from legal and ubs on creating confirmations for eol transactions  there were some discussions with  reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions  one firm and i dont remember whether it was ubs or not mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations  that is a completely different activity than we normally engage in and would make a difference in staffing  perhaps requiring more people   we need to know those things from ubs to take a real stab at a revised

hi thanks he is graduating on june 16by the way did you see some of the movies i recommendedto you
i know you are swamped with other matters so i jotted down in memo form my travel plans  i guess its s law that i got the phone call that i need to travel now in the midst of current work events
not until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package  remember rtos are still voluntary the courts have yet to require ferc to do away with the native load exception and nerc is in charge of reliability  this is clearly the biggest issue for the publics
so the short answer is that ees needs to change its procedures  also is the 50kw right for all markets
was unable to make contact about the trailer soryy about the delay just a little busy dodging bullets
in what forum will this be discussed
we were approached a few months ago regarding this benchmarking studyyou and i decided jointly against s involvementin this project they have approached us again any thoughts
i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley  i think he heads up the trading track program  this is the best way to get into trading now  you have to do 3 6mo rotations in different trading support roles  contact him and he should be able to get you more info  hope that helps you out
the past two years  has offered a very effective twoday session called executive influence and impact  this is required of everyone at the vp level and above and participation is definitely tracked  i thought that the class was very helpful  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participants leadership in communicating with and motivating employees   will now offer this course tailored for directors and senior directors   i would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity  unfortunately i didnt find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors  i want to work with the entire management team to create that plan as sessions will be offered in may september november and february 2002  however today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session may 16 and 17  this will be given in   i would like to have several participants from our team in this first session  my suggestion would be that  herod and  scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to shona  and thresa  as directors  i have asked  to secure four spots for us using these names as participants  if this timing does not work please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the may session  we would have to name a sub right away so please get back with me asap and confirm that the four names that i have suggested will be able to attend or let me know your recommendation on a substitution  thanks

san  oct 18 2001 forestweb  weyerhaeuser co will increase the us price of its northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk price by 20tonne to 500tonne effective nov 1 according to a buyer source another buyer source said weyerhaeuser has increased his price by 20tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys and i assume on the others weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the us price of 480tonne for oct 1 when other north american producers went to 500tonne the competitors have complained that weyerhaeusers price was a drag on their efforts producers and buyers alike have said that 500tonne has been a hard sell in october partly because of the market but also because demand has been so slow a number of sources say nbsk is at 480tonne for october though a few are paying the 500tonne price i dont think we will pay 500 in november a buyer said today i think it will be 490 an agent today described the weyerhaeuser news as a plus but added now all we need is for demand to pick up another agent also responded cautiously there is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up certainly not in the paper business without that producers can announce what they want to but it is not a slam dunk he said as for october transaction  aid that in most cases they didnt move i know everyone needs price increases and i know the inventories have gone down but my feeling is they will go up again he said noting typical latefall patterns  said that in contrast to the past paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices its going to be a battle for sure he said theres a lot of fighting going on a lot of buyers are saying theyre not going to pay it

here are some questionscomments i have regarding the ruling1  how does the cap apply to index prices  if the djpv index settles at 120 and the cap is 98 do parties selling index have to adjust there price to 982  would financial products swaps be affected by the cap3  there has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets  for example assume its a monday and the iso is under normal conditions and the price is 92  then assume on he 14 the iso declares a stage one and the price clears at 100 and the price is 100 for the rest of the day  tuesday assume the price is 85 during the first few offpeak hours but the wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as monday  what is the day ahead cash cap trading tuesday for wednesdayis it 85 or 100  one could make the argument that it should be 100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on wednesday but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage oneit seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded  so for the example they may recognize its likely a stage 1 100 cap will be in effect on wednesday so theyll set the cap at 100  the market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity  more efficient market less litigation4  what about call options  if a generator owns a call option at 125 the cap is 100 but the market is actually trading 150 does the generator have the right to exercise the option  what if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at 150  does the generator have to wait until the price hits 150  seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense  and would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option

after reviewing the doorstep audit at long beach with the team i have the following conclusion1 we should shut these offices down because we can not control them they dont make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at long beachor2 we establish a rigid template for how these offices operate my thought is that we create a mcdonalds hamburger type operation each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules hamburger quality is monitored from  routinelythere are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceedany thoughts

fyi  in case you hadnt seen it  interestingly no mention of the transfer of the gas assetsbestpge restructuring bid draws state ire by dale kasler and  peytonbee staff writers published sept 21 2001in a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy pacific gas and electric co proposed a radical restructuring thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utilitys valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants to make the plan work pge asked a us bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing powerplant ownership  a request that triggered immediate opposition from california officials pge said the plan a complicated blend of asset transfers debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs would restore the utilitys financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state bailout divorcing the utility from its parent company the plan would pay off the entire 132 billion of debt pge accumulated during californias poorly executed era of deregulation the plan filed in us bankruptcy court in san  had the support of a key block of creditors including independent energy generators whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan but it ran into immediate opposition from gov gray  and other state officials setting up a potentially fierce battle despite pges claims to the contrary they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because pge could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants the proposal would have the state public utilities commission relinquish control over those plants to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has proven over the last 18 months to be  no friend of the ratepayer  told reporters thursday the puc while far from perfect has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the federal energy regulatory commission  im very wary of pges proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a nonregulated environment the puc vowed to fight the plan in court i dont think the judge is going to do it said puc president  lynch consumer advocates noted that pge has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants its complete piracy said  hoge head of the utility reform network of san  its the most audacious thing ive ever seen filed six months after the utility sought

 talked to whalley on this he said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesnt demotivate people so i guess we should keep working on it but it most likely wont go anywhere a big concern  has now is that we have 7 billion of intl assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets you need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time
branches  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party which under isda can only be a bankrestrictions  things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading paymentsettlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it  it is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff  examples would be  masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions no oral trades allowed only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures  you can do a sort on the pending swap update  executed which will then show you all the restrictions then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions  but we dont want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff  just critical dont trade unless you look at this stuff

had asked me whether this contract had rofr or not because he thinks it should be terminated but cas is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a rofr flag on it in cbs  i think that this contract does not have rofr but could you confirm this for me  if my memory is correct i thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk  more recently tk to roll for another month or so  if im thinking of the right contract that would mean that it did not have a rofr because it was not for a year or longer and that it terminated 3312001could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term  if not then this agreement should not have the rofr contract on itlet me know  thanks

a dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor  we have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment uncertain about future employment and now with new information about lays golden parachute i am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the company hero or zero attitude or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade  i hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the company similar to what was done when we sold hpl  the general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the little people that have been making the money for the company are left out in the cold  i also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next yeari know the first move i suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100 commited to   this may be too drastic action at this point but i think it should watched closely

here are my comments1  i wouldnt agree the caps have hurt liquidity  in fact in the northwest at least they have actually increased liquidity  any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things 1 uncertainty about the level of the cap and 2 when the dayahead prices trade above the cap removing marketers as sellersi would propose the following cap timelines  first of all i think its important that ferc realize the spot market really is two separate markets what we call the dayahead cash markets and dayof realtime markets  the 24hour designation doesnt dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants  for example dayahead cash typically trades from 600 am to approximately 700 am for next day deliveries  however on thursdays the wscc otc market trades for friday and saturday deliveries and on fridays we trade for sunday and monday all of this can be adjusted for various reasons but this is the typical schedule  if we held to the 24hour spot cap literally then tuesday thru friday the cap would apply to the dayahead market but would not apply to saturday and monday  this obviously cannot be an intended consequence  i recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the dayahead wscc otc trading timelinesin addition there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the dayahead market  what if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that realtime markets will be trading above the 85 threshold  assume that stage i ii or even iii is a certainty  it seems prudent that a higher dayahead price cap be established still consistent with fercs guidelines  why  because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into realtime rather than scrambling to dispatch units realtime  it seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the dayahead price cap equal to either the 85 or stage i limit prior to trading time  this board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective  establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming in fact it should be fairly easythe cap governing realtime transactions is clear  however

i spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an american drew bedroom furniture set  at the time i was purchasing the furniture from a company in north  after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores  we had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and i would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands  after several unexpected delays i have canceled my order and received a full refund from the north  company  if you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before i would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately  i am sure you are busy however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me i would like to discuss purchasing the furniture  you can reach me at 7138535933 at work or on my cell at 7134327163   thanks    cuilla

lavo has given me the idea that  redmond may not be part of netco and it is possible that the texas gas origination business may go away completely  i would like to talk to you before you make a final decision  i do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the east and central it is a source of information for the trading business  it is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market  my opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process  give me a call to discuss at 7138533079regards

thanks for the info  i wanted to pick your brain about cars for mom and dad  my initial research of large cars and luxury cars in consumer report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me  i only considered cr recomended  cars  there are a few options in the 20000 to 25000 range for example the ford crown mecury grand  but i do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to  the only car in the 30000 to 35000 range is the buick park avenue which i think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but im not sure they want to spend this kind of money  of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example the  town car and cadillac deville are in the 40000 to 45000 rangedad said he spent 23000 for his olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks  my plan at this time is to focus on the crown grand  and the park avenue first and see if they come close to meeting mom and dads needsany thoughtslove

 kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit coned to discuss the benchmark rate swap  i think its a great idea  gahn and i had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran urm  my only thoughts for you would be 1 maybe difficult to do the swap with the utility given puc oversight but the holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from puc scrutiny and 2 being long td assuming that you dont sell 100 of the position to customers creates interesting regulatory questionsid love to sit down with you to discuss this product

privileged and confidential  request for legal advice some further questions are we required to have a formal severance plan  can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a casebycase basis perhaps with rule of thumb guidelinesif we are required to have such a plan should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistenciesmy original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern  perhaps because our plans are complicated we have had occasions where an employee was told something what heshe was told was incorrect heshe changed position based on what heshe was told and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake  obviously the right answer is to get it right the first time but on those occasions where we made the mistake do we have the flexibility to fix it

 rabon is an analyst in the texas risk group who is interested in interviewing for the trading track program  he joined the company in february 2001 from coastal where he worked in their natural gas risk group  he seems to be sharp aggressive and willing to work hard  can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round
last night i spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track  carlsson and  considine is currently tutoring at hofstra after leaving an option trading position  i would recommend bringing  to  for further interviews based on his technical knowledge  the biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation was working as an equity market maker  he is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise  he is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades  the trading track would be an excellent match for his desires  i would also recommend bringing  to  for further consideration

two things  when aleck said that he was leaving effective immediately does that mean one cant use email to send him a note to wish him well  if thats the case do we have a forwarding telephone number for himalso just wanted to make sure youre aware that calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts  his concerns are twofold  generally he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with and specifically were tied up with allegheny sp  ive told him that we dont like the contracts that were talking to folks about how bad they are but were staying under radar and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyones contract rights

thanks so much for sending me your friends resume  he certainly has a strong academic and work historyunfortunately it is not s practice to hire attorneys right out of law school  we prefer that our candidates have at least 46 years minimum experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here  the rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training which is critical for new lawyers nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who dont have the requisite experienceso please thank your friend for his interest  if you would like i would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school  alternatively he may be a candidate for the associate and analyst program if he doesnt want to practice lawcall me with any questions

all eight students that we interviewed for the  scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program  i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us  s letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year  i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter

consumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity  los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general  lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companieswe believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said  ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void three weeks after budhrajas january hire date  companies wmb news msgs won a 34 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 12 years budhraja disclosed in midaugust that his company the electric power group was paid more than 10000 by  during the previous 12 months budhraja was hired by the california department of water resources to negotiate power contracts but hasnt said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the  contract was signed it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the  contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover the groups also are concerned that budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a 39 billion contract with allegheny energy inc aye news msgs while he owned stocks in energy companies according to the release the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san  chronicle reported monday the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy

it really was unbelievable  our neighborhood usually doesnt have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain at one point they say it was 6 per hour was so high that it just couldnt drain away that fast  the water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage not high enough to get in the car covered the pool and completely surrounded the house  it looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in  just one more inch and id be in big trouble  luckily i slept through the whole thing  if id been awake i would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs  furniture to the second floor  a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside  the garage apt tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldnt start without being jumped  i got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear  no standing water anywhere  by the time i got up in the morning it was all goneinterstate 10 where it goes near our place say from downtown out to the loop looked like a river  the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges  i didnt see it myself but i hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between montrose and shepherd  you missed a big one

fyi  appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiationbestbattle lines drawn over longterm power deals sd union tribune 100701in a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the california public utilities commission as the focus this time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs in a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business consumer advocates celebrated when the puc refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases but business leaders and the governor cheered the puc for approving a 33 billion rescue of southern california  which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout as massive as the  deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of sdge than the second reality that emerged last week despite the puc action on the contracts californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity or maybe not while electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals duress allegedconsumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind california to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need we should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said  ahern a senior analyst with consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine we did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that

this gets even better  on tuesday april 3 i had our california prescheduler ask the iso day ahead personnel why the cob sn atc had been decreased so much  there reply was that the atc is calculated by taking the ttc less existing transmission contracts less ftrs less capacity benefit margin  normally and up until january 1 of this year they havent used a capacity benefit margin when calculating atc leaving the state  so the amount of atc they had at cob sn is normally in the 700 to 800 mw range rather than the 35 to 60 mw of atc they are using nowwe asked what this capacity benefit margin was and they said its not in their tariff its in the nerc operating manual  i went to the nerc web site and sure enough capacity benefit margin is a defined term  it reads  capacity benefit margin is the amount of ttc reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirementsthe isos use of this language is outrageous  this is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation  i can see them using this argument with respect to cob ns but no way cob sn  in fact one could very easily argue that they are violating this criteria  if we have load in the northwest and have purchased generation in california we should have access to available transmission

fyi   below is written by our environmental consultant eeabased on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just released the allowance surplus for this year is 23189 tons bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83778 tons  this would mean a flow control value of 026 or a discount factor of 063 for 2002  the exact flow controldiscount values cannot be calculated right now because they will depend on how many banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on the implementation of the maryland consent decree which the state and epa probably wont figure out until next year  but we are pretty much in that range

great question  if you think it would be useful i can back channel to  and find out  im of the view that this letter is more to refute angelides so that his wild assertions dont go unanswered in the court of public opinion  perhaps the letter should be addressed to angelides instead  on the other hand i think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the puc has the regulatory tools processes etc necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand and ensure that theres not the sort of massive costshifting to which angelides refers on the other  in the publics view this has been painted as an eitheror issue either we end direct access or granny faces death and destruction  and thats just not the case in fact i think it can be argued that the scenario angelides paints just isnt in the cards period  but i may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views  let me know if youd like me to find out if  thinks the letter would help her could find that out in pretty short orderbest

after talking to  i have a new plan of attack for schedule es  he informed me that the toplevels were typically put in at one region level per roll  i had zhiyun rerun the killed deals calc post id 15667  everyone should go back into the rolls and put the toplevels into their correct regions also adjusting the schedule es  this is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spotsi have also identified where the 46 mm difference for oppd arose from  deal  1167804 has not been transferred into the east bank book  in addition there are no volumes in this deals however if you look back to the official 11302001 calc there are volumes for this deal  it gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for oppd 116784 and 5648261  deal 5648261 was transferred but the valuations are approximately 4mm different  i have printed detail for deals 116784 and 5648261 they are in caseys chair as of the 11302001 official calc  i have also printed deal 5648261 in the 11302001 bankruptcy calc  i noticed that i cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc  please recalc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into detailsother than  who has to perform some it testing no one should be working or playing on anything other than trying to get these schedule es and toplevels figured out  the task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbersthanks
great job and great team stick to your guns going forward

getting alot of inquiriesthe puc has not yet voted on suspension of da or related matterslikely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 3060 minuteslooks as if the decision will 1 suspend da beginning sept 20th and 2 include contract renewal in the suspension  in addition it appears that the proposal would give the commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to july 1 if deemed necessary this is unclear and were trying to get more details on this provisionthree key senators have sent a a letter to the puc asking the puc to provide recommendations to the legislature on the conditions under which da should be reinstated since the letter is dated september 18ththough sent only yesterdayit appears that the senate had an idea that the puc was going to suspendkeep in mind that the decision has not been voted on yet and the provisions listed above may changewell report back as soon as something happensfor folks who want to listen in the number is4152284550code  92105best

heres the proposalthere is no reason for the puc to suspend da since 1 18xx passedtherefore the bonds are taken care of all  has to do is sign the bill 2 angelides has said that moneys not an issue at least for the next several months and 3 the senate passed a resolution on friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the state of emergency put in place by  on jan 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore endthe puc should therefore keep da intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable da while achieving other important objectives eg no costshifting make sure bonds get serviced etcif however the puc rejects this rational sensible proposal and decides to suspend da then that date must not be any earlier than sept 20th and if it is we will suethoughtsbest

consumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general  lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companieswe believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said  ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the  contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san  chronicle reported monday the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the states energy crisis to negotiate highpriced contracts according to the report the average price of power under the contracts is 69 a megawatthour more than double peak electricity prices last week budhraja disclosed in august that he owned as much as 10000 in scottish power stock while a 1 billion longterm contract with subsidiary pacificorp was being hammered out the state signed the 10year contract july 6 budraha sold his stock july 30 state officials say budhraja had nothing to do with the deal according to the report

we would prefer physical rights that we can take dayahead andor realtime 5 minutes ahead if possible   rather than an obligation like ftrs we prefer an option spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised i would want to condition the transaction on having one rto in the ne with lmp pricing in effect for the entirie ne market on or before 112003   assuming we get over those hurdles this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally fixed cost structure therefore we need to earn a minimum of 25 expected return after credit obviously there is a huge unknown on the ct vs long island forward curve with the changing market conditions   this makes pricing this deal extremely difficult particulary with the returns we would need to show call me with any additional questions
also will you get  to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regionsthanks

you have the latitude to put your key people under contract    was very clear when i talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers
i understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter  our practice and intent has been to pay after they start and i believe that the letter refers to payment after they start so there is some wiggle room on the other sidei agree that it is not a slam dunk on our part but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim  we then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed  in the meantime i am comfortable with this level of riskof course if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money then the waiver should address the signing bonus issueyall let me know if you disagree

i wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before i considered your annex a which i would like to compare to the ena current version  we are currently considering more revisions so your annex a will help me to think a biti have attached a redline of the actual confirm without annex a  a couple of thoughts1for purposes of creating a template i gave a choice for termination date2i collapsed payment dateinvoice because im concerned that ejc may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed3we need to fix the floating price language  i dont know where the reference to north sea west africa mediterranean comes from  i didnt see it in marketwire and london doesnt use it  also the conversion language is vague ie ttm ttb and tts are not defined but i suspect they refer to bidmidsell  are they references on the bank of tokyomitsubishi ltd screen  also it may be better to create a conversion reference to your central bank and not a particular banking institution you could get caught later dealing with that bank using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage4i didnt see your schedule 1 guarantee but i assume that it is the normal ene format regarding annex a i quickly noticed an issue with the tibor definition which uses quite a bit of isda language which can be easily fixed with an appropriate isda reference  give me another day or so to commentlet me know if youd like to talk  my home number is 7136643207 if youd like to callregards

i base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations when i was at bankers trust every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal can you tell us where we can get a cheap offtheshelf system that we can use to manage these things  the problem kiodex has is exactly what you describe with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission the third party asp model is an extremely difficult one to sell there are all the obvious reasons security reliability continuity etc what kiodex needs to focus on in my opinion is the intersection of customers who need the product but dont view the function as critical to their operationfor what it is worth

before we do anything on this issue i would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues primarily the proper reformation of the px credit calculation after jan 18 and the application of the 1ckwh surchargeon this issue assuming that we havent discuss the failure of sce to apply our accounts past credit with the cpuc given that the bills were just received i cant imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action  in addition we have not identified where the credits are if they are not on the customers accounts  my recommendation is to first a work with sce  have  dasovich run the traps and b discuss the issue with cpuc division of energy and see if there is a solution without complaint if this doesnt get us anywhere before august 19 then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the cpuc  i am not opposed to lebouef looking into federal action but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remediesplease call meps there is a meeting on the 1ckwh surcharge with  dietrich today at 130 in her office  i think you should attend

i just listened to the presentation on the gisb final rule on intraday recallsthe final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases1 by may 2002 pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective july 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper2 with respect to recalls during the flowing gas day the commission directs naesb gisb to file comments by october 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated with reply comments by october 15commissioner massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability  staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable  the releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not  the discussion of the order seems to be in step with ets pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity releaserecall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day  the fact that comments arent even being filed on phase 2 until oct   i think were safe to assume that this phase wont be implemented until 2003

calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit new york sept 27 reuters  california state treasurer  angelides said thursday the state could face a 93 billion budget deficit in the 20022003 fiscal year if 125 billion of power bonds are not sold before july 2002 the treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the california public utilities commission puc into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds what i am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed angelides said in a telephone news conference in sacramento referring to a law passed in february setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion the state depleted its general fund by at least 62 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases there can be no schedule for the bond sale until the puc completes its work angelides said earlier this week the puc said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for oct 2 angelides said puc commissioner  brown one of five is on board to make the vote but president  lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with angelides and the department of water resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement how the money from rate increases approved in may will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the department of water resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the puc angelides is projecting a 31 billion budget deficit for the 20022003 fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall us economy slows in a worst case scenario angelides added that with the bond sale the 31 billion gap may grow to 4 billion while a late sale would push the 93 billion number to 102 billion the treasurer painted a dire picture of california s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early 1990s angelides warned a 2 percent

      this would be preferable but i dont understand what rules could be changed to alter the existing accounting treatment  also s numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project and id bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed  the other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow  we will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market which is the only way to do high injectionhigh withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies  are you okay with that  i am

 america  the good neighbor widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from toronto by  sinclair a canadian television commentator  what follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional record this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth germany japan and to a lesser extent britain and italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts  none of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the united states when france was in danger of collapsing in 1956 it was the americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of paris when earthquakes hit distant cities it is the united states that hurries in to help this spring 59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes nobody helped the  plan and the  policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries  now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering americans id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the united states dollar build its own airplane  does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the boeing jumbo jet the lockheed tristar or the  dc10  if so why dont they fly them why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon you talk about japanese technocracy and you get radios  you talk about  technocracy and you get automobiles you talk about american technocracy and you find men on the moon  not once but several times  and safely home again you talk about scandals and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at  even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded  they are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking canadian laws are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here when the railways of france germany and

i have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the ecoelectrica offices  it looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials  mere possession of these materials is a violation of law  our outside counsel called the fbi which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there it does not have  a duty to report itwe also received advice that the puerto  office of the fbi might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved  our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local fbi office and talk with a duty agent  the number is 7877546000  given the situation of the possible sale however we may choose not to take that routein any event if we dont report it all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible

i  send you the wire confirmation later
realistically only the trading support provided for straightforward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode  i would say that the only part of it development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees  capital projects dont make sense on a cost per transaction basis  should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and enw agree upon while we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction i still have concerns about this on a lot of levels  frankly the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the eol relationship  if we are boxed into a cost per transaction then whenever  lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of pl we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly  practically speaking there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isnt needed yesterday and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired  i also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement  i will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people  the guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of ea in mind   they work hard to insure success for ea  that is what  and  should want  push us back too far and no one will like the results if we dont have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support  it is kind of ironic  i think that  is pleased with how ive managed operations and one of my goals when i took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for   i have some really good people who are very motivated and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at ea egm eim etc  we had to work
ill get  findsen to call you  can you have at least 1 trader interview him as wellthanks

we would like to hire this person for the summer standard offerthanks
thanks   im having a very difficult time seeing how  will have any choice other than to vigorously and respectfully 1 decline to offer up any contracts and 2 assert our view that  wood it is unfair to attempt to impose any quid pro quo ie forcing folks to waive their due process rights by declining to hand contracts over to best

our meeting with eim is set for monday october 12th from 900 to 1030   bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with  sweeney   just initiated that meeting himself with  one day last week spur of the moment  but that is the only meeting regarding enw budgets that has taken place  i have been working with  castleman eims cao since last week to arrange our meeting now set for monday  i think that by agreed plan mcmahon just means that is the amount that at this point eim is saying they are willing to take

looks like ader  co at work in ercot   i view this as a big problem   these customers need to be covered by wholesale   both of you should take this as a slap in the face
most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyones psychological 4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short  next sellers need to be from producer community  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the ep community  short covering rallies will get more common here  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good except maybe in bid week  my concern is if we go to 4 and people want to cover some shorts whos selling it to them  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break 5

if this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it  the potential upside of the entex audit is more like 2  3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving nonperformance  in the past ena and entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term  obviously we will not have that remedy  do not let aep separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death

calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit new york sept 27 reuters  california state treasurer  angelides said thursday the state could face a 93 billion budget deficit in the 20022003 fiscal year if 125 billion of power bonds are not sold before july 2002 the treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the california public utilities commission puc into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds what i am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed angelides said in a telephone news conference in sacramento referring to a law passed in february setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion the state depleted its general fund by at least 62 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases there can be no schedule for the bond sale until the puc completes its work angelides said earlier this week the puc said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for oct 2 angelides said puc commissioner  brown one of five is on board to make the vote but president  lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with angelides and the department of water resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement how the money from rate increases approved in may will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the department of water resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the puc angelides is projecting a 31 billion budget deficit for the 20022003 fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall us economy slows in a worst case scenario angelides added that with the bond sale the 31 billion gap may grow to 4 billion while a late sale would push the 93 billion number to 102 billion the treasurer painted a dire picture of california s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early 1990s angelides warned a 2 percent

i just cant get too enthused about the short side  why did cash go out trading 5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week  fine  whats it going to trade next week  the gas daily swap implies flat but its lagged the actual spread all month  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space  so either the market is wrong maybe but a dangerous assumption to make or i dont see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high but those certainly dont seem to be going down very fast  march is off 8 cents since jun 29  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354 then why is sep too high at 298

to explain the pl of 349000   we executed the trade when you gave the order the delta anyway first thing in the morning  the market rallied 8 cents from the morning with the back rallying about 25 cents  on 904 pv contracts curve shift was 226000  the balance 123000  is almost exactly 01 bidmid which i think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol  cal 3 straddles for instance are 139  145looking out for you bubbeh

our marks are fine at least through 04 where we occasionally see s   i dont think its appropriate to shut down anything  we need to price the product properly and offpeak needs just as much margin as onpeak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growthrather than shut down products increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market   we are chipping away at our offpeak position day by day and we have bought some nymex coalam i making sense   in addition i am working with  to buy 7x24 from fpl in north texas for both desks   we will probably have to pay 350400 spread to get 35 year 7x24 deal donewith respect to ne the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for offpeak therefore in some ways the risk is easier to manage
kaufman and i met earlier this week with gov geringer of wyoming  he is supportive of a single rto though it is not clear that he favors a ferc mandate  he will wlso be pulling together a small group of western govs to meet with  wood to discuss the negative impacts of fercs refund and rate cap proceedings on western power markets outside of california  he has asked us for two things which i believe   l and  are working onagenda and briefing paper we would propose for the govs meeting with wooda white paper describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processeslike most western govs geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened  geringer will also be participating in bingamins panel on or about oct 9

here is my analysis of my guys maggi 2  pl for first half a bit misleading  up till today he has run and taken the pl for 7 days  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in july so far  running eol is a law of averagessome days you get killed some you do well  the second day he got massacred t boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day  pl for that day was 7  the four days in july have been really good probably 67  so i look at his pl for the first half of the year as jan 1jul 6  that pl of 15 is around my expectations  runs low var  pretty good at running eol when im not there  a little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help  makes most money in market making probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift  would like for him to turn both of those positive  a bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info  required to spend all time in front of computer  needs to develop  griffith to allow him to get off the desk more  good contrarian trader  often has opposite position of floor  willing to stop out and is nimble  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody elses positions  vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now  cannot function without one of us on the desk computer causing problems  will email with other guys later
the commission suspended direct access effective september 20ththe decision orders the utilities to stop accepting dasrs for contracts executed after 92001but astonishingly the language in the proposed decision states that the commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to july 1  in short that battle continueshow the commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this timethe commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between dwr and the pucbest

 from what i am hearing we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around  prior to the move in  i still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week once things settle down  assuming they do i look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts  it is my observation that we have not made the progress i would have liked in terms of information flow and although there has been progress there is a ways to go this probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything elselooking forward to those discussions

 this recipe is from my paris cooking class  it is supposed to be wonderful served chilled when we cooked it in class we served it warm  be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway  also after you puree it in the blender   our cooking teacher recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth she says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients  it is part of the parisian mystery of cooking good luck

per  lavorato we killed all desk to desk deals on dec 13th  that is why this deal was killed  you mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed  can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed  it is our understanding that all desk to deskbook to book should be killed because no cash actually changes hands  should this deal have been with an external counterparty
port should be contacting you shortly we are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc has to be submitted for next board meeting i dont think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in  corp var so the allocation becomes critical should be an interesting discussion more to come

i do have comments to this confirm  i have never seen your isda master agreement master so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict  1is suntrust the calc agent under your master should they be agent for this deal2need to upgrade definitions to 2000 definitions the 1991 and 1998 definitions have been superseded3are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by suntrust in the manner set out there is no valuation or payment timedate for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option  this language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind4do you have existing transactions with suntrust on your books in addition to this one5are there any additional termination events under the master  you dont want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring  also it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with suntrust is related to the loan agreement for purposes of giving suntrust the right to terminate  is it6defining an event as either an event of default or a termination event has different settlement consequences  it looks like youre not concerned as to how suntrust values terminated transactions if this deal is related to the loan agreement i think part 2d would be clearer if stated asadditional termination event will apply  the following shall constitute an additional termination event with respect to the counterparty cite events i and ii if accurate   for the purpose of the foregoing termination event the affected party shall be the counterpartythis means suntrust will calculate as if you were in default  or do you want to calculate at mid6you should delete par 2a  i dont believe you have agreed to do this in the past but perhaps you do not mind  your lawyer should review the impact of stating this provision shall constitute an additional agreement for the purpose of section 4 of the swap agreement7are the economics of the deal stated correctly8what transactions are being superseded  has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained

hi congratulations on sidestepping what many including us thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions were as glad as anybody that it hasnt happened i have a quick question  your consultant for gas procurement a fellow named  baldwin until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units transwestern gas pipeline   has informed us that we wont be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with with that in mind i was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than  who doesnt face the same conflict issues that we could meet with to discuss providing lowcost gas services to california  were very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflictfree environment  but it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the states consumers  if theres someone we can talk to and avoid even the appearance of conflictofinterest wed be very anxious to do sothanks for your time and hope all is wellbest

commissioners  m duque and  a bilas dissentingone could say that this order is consistent with the administrations present third world country mentality we are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale marketwe are not convinced that the department of water resources dwr bond ratings depend on killing direct access  this notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds direct access should be seen as a benefit to dwr  it would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve dwr from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner something else is going on here we think that the dwr does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it will make dwrs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear the commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by dwr finance and the treasurer  instead the commission is making an ill informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later dwr and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if dwr is making prudent energy purchases only if dwrs contracts are too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices indeed retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on dwr to make more prudent purchases this is a very important consideration since ab 1x prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the dwr costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds if there is no yardstick how can anyone measure dwr performance the answer is one cant unless sb 18xx is signed into law  we think that additional review of these issues before suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in the long run for these reasons we must respectfully dissents henry m duque  s richard a bilas         m duque a bilas       commissioner   commissionerseptember 20 2001

fyi the risk management and reporting was allocated to tw for all 12 months of 2001  however since i came back to tw in may lee ferrell left  in june and  and  moved to s rc in november the 15 number dwindled during the latter part of the year   and bobby were the only ones in this rc that were part of this allocation all 12 months thanks 
my apologies for not getting back sooner but i sort of wanted to see how the  realtime products did before proceeding with this  it seems like realtime is a success so lets get going with this i call this product dart dayaheadrealtime  its basically a physical product that is transacted on a dayahead cash basis but is delivered on realtime  for example on the dayahead lets say i post a us pwr phy firm  midc peak oct04 to oct05 dart  27 at 28  if i get hit then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on oct 5th realtime 25 mw each hour  i would be long realtime at 27  if a party lifts my 28 then i would be obligated to deliver to them on oct 5 realtime 25 mw each hour  i would be short at 28the mechanics of this deal are much like a regular dayahead cash transaction  the primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular dayahead transactions that needed to be prescheduledas far as the product language goes i think if you add the following language to what you provided below we should be ok obviously subject to legal reviewthis product is intended to be transacted on a dayahead basis for delivery on a realtime basis  day ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery consistent with wscc scheduling and trading practices  realtime means the actual delivery day  realtime deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted wscc scheduling timelines and practicestake a look give me a call  thanks

hey1  theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ice after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote  this is a prearranged trade and is illegal on nymex but it is my understanding it will be legal on ice assuming ice uses the ipe clearing platform where prearranged trading is legal   agree about liquidity  i dont think this really helps ices volumes nor liquidity  funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ice in the current state  2  my guess is not intercommodity but maybe intracommodity  for instance a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive  important note ice is our competition and i am veryvery wary to support their system unless absolutely necessary
no problem  thanks for playing  hopefully we can keep in touch and have the same people next year  i will be settling the league up shortly and will send you a checkhow are things going otherwise

agreement executed friday nov 9 2001 and received by goldman
folkshere are my edits  for simplicity i accepted all the other changes and put mine in strikeoutunderlinethey are confined to the direct access section and to the provisions regarding spot market service in particular  based on our negotiations i think its accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as an option to elect  instead the language in the agreement states that it is a backstop in the event that on any given day a customers esp doesnt show up with the power  in effect it retains the utilitys duty to serve like the gas side but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided  ive also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program ie the transition date the customer for whatever reason fails to elect term service or direct access service  in both cases the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days after which the customer must choose term or direct access serviceplease take a look at the language  while i havent put any stakes in the ground up till now i feel strongly about these changes for reasons im happy to discuss and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document id request that we have a very brief call to discuss  i believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with in addition ive also taken a stab at language requested by delainey ie what to do about da in the interm  there may be better ways to craft the language but i took a shot nonethelessfinally im assuming based on yesterdays call that by delivering this document to the speaker today no one is giving their approval support or anything else for each and every provision  im not prepared to and cannot do that at this timethanks again to all for all the effort and to  for her patience in hearing me out earlierbest
zwe have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with netco   these directories be moved so that the estate cant use them or will copies be made so both groups could use the files  if not we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already
while i think the law actually works that way we have avoided putting it in writing so far  the way the web site works the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless  the time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they dont see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out  i guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer  the website doesnt provide a mechanism for that  if we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader in practice it might not be an issue
we would love for you to join us eric

here is my two centsfrom your message i understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches overhang the condominium fence  if so then the tree belongs to ashford  the condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line but may not go onour property or destroy the tree  a landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree isobstructing a public road   a landowner cant be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something  sincethe condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety there doesnt appear to be a negligence issuefurther a landowner isnt negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm  if the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree they would have to do so on a nuisance theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property  still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerousbottom line  we dont have a responsibility to trim the tree but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues dont ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down

my suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature  i am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other  if we must have meetingspresentations have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations  as far as where to go  san  or galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size  if you are ok with spending more the golfing fishing and spa activities in florida miami key west tampast  are great  also golfing rafting and spas in colorado would be good tooi dont have a strong preference for where we go but i do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other

ive had an idea for a new eol product that i would like to start our eol legal and contracts people thinking about  its kind of a weird product but i think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it wasits called the day aheadrealtime parklend product  essentially its a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time  for example lets say morgan  agrees to sell us 25 mw onpeak for 25 but that it is not prescheduledit is to be settled real time  if we fast forward to realtime morgan  has two options  they can buy from us on eol whereby this transaction books out or they can deliver us physical power whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time  the nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time even if they are not a control area  in addition it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a dayahead position im not sure if its you i need to talk to about this but i would appreciate some direction if its somebody else  once we identify who we need to look at this id like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and eol mechanicsthanks

i am forwarding this message to you sent to me by  superty   is the director of gas logistics for  americas and attended the lunch meeting that i held yesterday  i asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale  i can always count on  to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request  here are his ideas  some of these i can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader  net works employee base  some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees  i would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an wide basis is you think that would be appropriate  i could certainly use some help however  you may already have a venue for this but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals like  superty who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale  not a formalized committee and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized  just an ad hoc group to make a difference now  maybe this doesnt have to be corporate wide  maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas  this might be even more effective with buyin and initiative from the business units rather than the feel of a corporate overlay  as i am typing i am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in  net works and simply share what we are doing with others  your thoughts

on point 1  i think that at the end of the day ferc will not deal with the negative ctc directly  all they will do is reset prices  the utilities and the cpuc will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the px credit and hence the negative ctc  we have tried in the ca refund process to highlight the fact that much of the high prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the cpuc governor and utilities  the core problem with this line of argument is that the refund process didnt ask the first question  what or who is to blame  it simply took dysfunction and ran  we are trying in the context of the rehearing case to ask ferc to restart with the right question  also remember that we arent going to have a solution in the ferc case until sometime next year probably after sce gets its money  finally i think that the right policy decision is not to rebill negative ctc but rather to prospectively recover the costson point 2  see point above  i doubt however that all high prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling

as you guys know the 2003 pgt expansion plans are supposed to be 230000day the landscape of the shippers list is ever changing rumors of ppl pulling out 85000day to malin and stanfield is unconfirmed  we are trying to validate and potentially avista pulling out as they have been downgraded they hold 35000day in 2003 combined this is almost half of the planned expansion although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately i believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together as you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211000  day is made up 2 shippers calpine 35000day and newport gen 175000day and this expansion has its own issues  as we know more about shippers moving around i will pass on pls do same

a few thoughts before the ng meeting 1maybe we should as a team call transelect  buckman before our ng meeting  you may remember that transelect sent an initial letter into skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the ng application to be managing member of the arto  i think that it would be good to call buckman and ask if he has a better idea than ng  we are right now stuck between two very bad answers  let aep and fe construct a managing member or have ng  maybe transelect has a better solution2chief issues with ng aare they really independent  having a short position in ny and owning generation in ne effectively makes ng into a market participant  i think that  should make as a hold firm position that to operate an rto there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independencebwho do they feel the customer is  maybe we want to get  s take on their business model from the uk  it is critical that the new rto operators across the country view tradersmarketers and generators as their key customers  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want  pass thru pbr etc cwho writes the tariff  i would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the rto work to date has been that ferc has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little if any control over future changes  the rto operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints  1 must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and 2 must not damage the assets  ddo they intend to buildown transmission and how does this impact the energy markets  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that epmi may take in the energy market  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the businessehow do they intend to provide balancing energy  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances  what is ng intending to do on this issue  does ng believe that

per our conversation the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to trackcomputereport etcthe west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports  these balances are not reported by the respective pipelines however each day the injections and withdrawals are available  in the past our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior days balance  as we get validation of the balances through phone calls andor postings we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation  currently our reportingstorage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reportssynthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table  it is our intent to have a drn established and some already have been created that would hold the storage balance each day  however this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database  one possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped  another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity  lastly these storage balances could be manual entry points but would require manual calculation each day representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this featurethis is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets  at a minimum we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week  although we do not have a final date for transitioning we see this as one of a few critical tasks

 i presented a form of assignment to pge as recently as 2 weeks ago including other structures generally speaking they hate the el paso pipe because of its flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that el paso deliverability becomes more reliable having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view  assuming you can agree on values but i think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get regardless it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further have  or  call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this assetthanks bt

regarding the need for the rmt confirms i have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed  if that is not the case i dont object to doing away with them altogetherwe have approved doing away with confirms for eol trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis  we havent actually gotten there with anyone yet having just started the actual discussions this week  our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate  initially we are only working on physical power physical natural gas and derivatives transactions other than weather  the idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered  this will obviously be a very timeconsuming and laborious process  the initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people  our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on texas and new york law analysis  if any canadian deals are at issue we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations this is helpful  let me know if it makes sense to youps  please be careful when sending emails to me  there are two  taylors and were hard to tell apart  the other guy has his middle initial a in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name but not mine  my name usually has my phone number next to it  were trying to get the it people to do something to better distinguish us

i have it in my briefcase i just forgot to get it out  another slow day so fari checked on the internet today about fanniemae and ginniemae per s comments the other day  i learned that ginniemae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for hud and fha loans  they are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans  fanniemae basically does the same thing but is a nongovernment owned company used to be government owned in 1967  both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country  so s friendrelative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area  based on some of the stories i read they tend to focus on really bad areas  my guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market  so to the extent there are hud or fha loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it  i had no idea what these two entities did kind of interesting

though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when  will call back the california legislature to address the  mou heres the latest information we havefaced with horrible polling an unwilling legislature an uncooperative california puc and a wily leader of the state senate   is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislaturerumors of a delay come despite  statements that he would call them back next weekwe received the information about a likely delay from an  svp whos working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallowits s view that the earliest  would now call the legislature back is end of next week with early the following week being most likelyat this point the chance remains that  may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off leaving  to follow pge into chapter 11in the meantime negotiations between  staff and staff from the senate and assembly continuewell report back with information as we get itbest

and legal would like to speak with one of you about the chase and morgan issues surrounding the master netting agreement requests  there seems to be some confusion  i think the chase request came from credit and the morgan request came directly from morgan  the items below summarize what i know about the two different counterparties1  at the request of chase and with s approval ena terminated the morgan guaranty trust company of new york master energy price swap agreement  all outstanding trades have been transferred to the april 5 1994 interest rate and currency exchange agreement between the chase manhattan bank and ena the chase master  when the merger is complete anticipated around november 10 2001 the survivor jp morgan chase bank will be enas counterparty under the chase master see letter agreement dated october 24 20012  the chase master has been amended several times most recently to provide for fx forward trades and resolve multibranch issues3  chase recently agreed that ena propose a new isda schedulecsa  legal has requested a credit worksheet4  among other things it appears that the chase master currently provides for first method  this has never been amended5  the chase master is used for fxrate and commodity tradeson a different note5  morgan  capital group inc has signed mininetting agreements with ectric  morgan now wants to sign similar mininetting agreements with erac and egli  i believe that  viverito is working on these agreements  morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ena but would like to see our master netting agreement and may decide to execute  three outstanding elfi financial trades will be reconfirmed under ena and i am waiting for morgan to forward that documentation6  both ena and  corp have been in the process of negotiating isda agreements with morgan  capital services inc  nothing has been executed  ectric has an executed isda with that entity7  the names morgan   co inc and morgan   co international limited also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessaryquestion  the master netting agreement assignment list contains the name jpmorgan  legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the jp morgan chase master netting agreement  question  does credit also want to send

ive been thinking about this i think 18 mos for the average tenor of a trade is way too high for  s book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months we would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for nymex gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months i think the same would probably be true for power but i havent spoken to those guys about it for the nymex book gas i made the following assumptionsaverage tenor 5 monthsaverage trades per day 400average volume per trade 500000 mmbtuaverage px 27mmbtuwith 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of 136bn this is simply 40025250000027you then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year if the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above which would be conservative given our 4 month assumptionthat takes you down to 6804bn 136bn2the next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties you are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty i am working on those numbers as i write this it stands to reason that the net number for nymex gas deals would be less than 70bn when you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and i will look at thatas a basic method does this start to get you to where you need to be

i view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites gas and power with the estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore   the estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitorsi cant imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by ubs and the estate   i am not planning on giving any of the data to the estate   i feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well   one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area

t hate me for sending a note  what do you thinkcalifornia made two big mistakes  first they never made a market  they didnt deregulate  they just reregulated the failed monopoly structure theyd been living with for decades  second when the first mistake led to an energy crisis californias leaders didnt stop learn from their mistakes and get deregulation right  instead they blamed everyone but themselves including   those mistakes led to the nightmare californias been living for over a year now and they still california still has woken ups the model of the virtual organization  whether the problems in california or  or sweden  creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem  thats what we did in california   is definitely the brain but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well  what makes the virtual part of it work is a committed management team great technology and an incredible team of talented flexible folks from across the company  that allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions its been a great experience

the letter looks good  a couple of comments for your considerationon page three we describe the change to the definition of public utility and then argue that we dont fit into it  would it be worth explaining why that makes sense  specifically the new jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution  the competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities  therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service  what those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers  the same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  the generation and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  these components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service  they do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service  because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations  indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationaleas a former practicing lawyer i certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative  but i question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing   i can just see the press seizing on s claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion  i suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not

maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that  uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people  then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples  when you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people  my guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people pre hpl sale
yall have a good day  c
but that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual partys economics  or does ferc not see that as a driver values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact  this would always put a seller at a disadvantage

managing var limits is essential and pl penalties are a great way to achieve this  however we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as 1 discouraging aggressive trading and 2 significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crimei still disagree with the 1 million fine for such a minor violation of our var limit  the punishment does not fit the crime what message are you trying to send  the message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times  also locations such as socal malin and pge should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes  i know these are not your intended messages  i realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding var  we have been making excellent progress towards var reduction in an environment in which the var calculation and tolerance are constantly changing   my suggestion for implementing a var control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum var utilization is a warning for minor breaches 500000 and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than 500000  the amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violationplease consider these suggestions  we want to play by the rules but the rules need to be fair and known in advance  also we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the 1 million from this morning

heyyou sound kind of bummed out there amiga  understandable though  tough and very weird times thats for sure  very sad  the funerals must have been brutal  i know im depressed by it because i get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically  hopefully things will improveour stock has just been munched  it sucks because were doing well but the other half of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors  everyone was wondering why skilling left i guess we know why nowenough of the gloom and doom  sounds like you are getting opportunitiesthats good  i knew that you would  heres some proscons for your options recalling my vast experience  structuring  interesting but not alot of dough  probably the most easily replaced by those fresh mbas  trading  like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed  can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times  good dough if you make it though  marketing  low immediate constant stress but still competitive  you have a great deal of charm and brains so i think you would do quite well in this area  in addition there are a number of firms calpine aep coral who are opening up an office in portland pretty much geared towards midmarketing  might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home plus you can buy me beer which is always a plus for anyones karmaas far as your overall attitude towards the industry i think i disagree  i think its a good industry to be in particularly now because no matter what people need electricity  and its still changing especially out west so there will be challenges and opportunitiesits great talking with you  cheer up  call your folks  run  punch a punching bag  do drugs kidding  take care of yourself and if you need anything give me a buzz or drop an email

greetings everyone had a pleasant 4thive read the respective  and hertzberg language on amending ab 1x  the  language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the hertzberg language tooim proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill  i would appreciate your feedback  the amendments would be as followscustomers who were on direct access when dwr started buying power jan 17th and are still on direct access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds in short customers should not be forced to pay for power twiceonce from their esp and once from dwr  since these customers receive power services from their esp they never consumed dwr power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for itcustomers who have been utility customers since dwr started buying power but subsequently switched to direct access should only pay for power provided by dwr that they actually consumed no more and no less  for example if a customer was a utility customer when dwr started buying power but switched to direct access on may 1st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing dwr for power deliveries that took place from jan 17th thru april 30thi believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 45 weeks  or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now and rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers i suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are  your thoughts are appreciatedin addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get california out of the energy hole that it finds itself in  providing 20kw and above customers with an incentive to switch to direct access as soon as possible could 1 reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility  2 reduce electricity purchasing costs and 3 reduce the burden on the state budgetwith this in mind im also proposing that the

i plugged the data on colonial oaks into your format  the actual noi for 2001 is around 305000  but there is not a professional management company  subtracting 25000 for management costs the noi would be 280000  however i increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to 3000unit  this would yield an noi of 240000  comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties it doesnt look like the rents have a great deal of upside  the asking price is 2700000  using 240000 would make this an 89 cap  using the sellers noi of 280000 would be a 104 cap  the cost per unit is 33750 for a 1969 project  the cost per square foot is 3658  the numbers would be better if the property was offered at 25 million   smith claims that 27 million is as low as the seller will go  this property has not been on the market  so i would like your input of what the market would pay for it  if 280000 is a reasonable noi then i would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for 27 million  it does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants  plus the location is by far the most convenientfinancing is the other consideration  i am assuming 25 year 7  and 25 down  what do you think could actually be achieved  can you put me in contact with a lenderi will follow up with a phone callthanks

this email is attempting to answer the request made by you and  a few weeks ago attached are my projected balance for 2004 nox sip call  it is based on numbers from eea environment consultants epa website nox sip call model and new generation database  the confidence level for overall balance is not that high  the otr states only need to reduce 15 from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance  they have some scrs already built and the plans for the other scrs needed  the nonotr states are far more dirty than the otr states  the big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states  i believe that there will be a demand for allowances  i believe the nox sip call market to be a short at this point  people think it is worse than it really isalso i can make a price forecast  the confidence level would be low on the price forecast  what else do you want here    taylor

and following up on our meeting today i need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our sun devil project  how much if any can i discount the fuel charges for sun devil shippers based on the following assumptions project cost 911mminclude all compression addsmods from  cebryk engineering scope dated 92801incremental volume mmbtud 780000 san  810000 mainline 500000 to phoenix 310000 to cal borderof 1520000 total capacity to cal border and 500000 to phoenix assume 390000 has to come from east of thoreauassume load factors in 10 increments from 50 west flow up to 100assume fuel collection of 5 from shippersin theory we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for sun devil and the new compressors at stations 14 are more efficient then the actual fuel use should be less  please verify this for the load factors above  if we can keep the same net fuel retainage but collect less because our actual fuel use is less then this is a winwin for both tw and the sun devil shippersis an answer possible by tuesday 1112thanks
kellythanks for getting back to me with your analysis  heres what ive donenot sure what the situation is with the lead expediter 95 position  the phone line of the manager for that one doesnt seem to be working and an email to him was returned as undeliverable  even though his name was in the company email address book  but hes in the same department as one of the jobs below sr purchasing agent i think and this position is a more junior slot so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anywaythe senior project manager 8090 and senior purchasing agent 80 slots are still open  i talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration  i have no feel for the timing on the proj mgr position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque but the guy on the purch agent job said the timing was great since hes taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to reviewive left voicemail messages concerning the construction engineer 90 and processmechanical engineer ii 80 positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking on the others it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website  particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly  theres no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resumeill keep you posted on the others  if there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week you might want to submit for those on the website too  at least then you know your resume is in the hopper

as i previously shared the result for vandium in the lowsulfer diesel 2 fuel oil came back at less 01 ppm versus the spec of less 005 ppm  i just talked to the lab supervisor at saybolt whom performed the analysis and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within onetenth of a ppmthe only way he knows of is to use a nmr nuclear magnetic resonance machine that nasa uses to analyze rocket fuel  he is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that if they did allow it could cost upwards of 10000 please let me know if we should pursue this matter any furtherthanks

some background information for the meeting with mayor brownbrown won 43 of the vote to sanchez 40 and is now in a run off with sanchez   waldens perspective not surprisingly is that brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters  african american turnout in the election was lower than expected but an active getoutthevote campaign could turn that around has supported the mayor with a 10000 contribution  i would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstancesif you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration you couldcongratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail propositioncompliment him on how he has responded to security issues since sept 11 and his handling of flood reliefyou should know that the  police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the october 26 threat to the  buildingwe have responded to the citys rfp for energy serviceees made a presentation last week proposing a 57 year transactionthe city is opting for a 12 year transactionthat would require very detailed load data which is in reliants possessionwe have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the citys effort to do a deal with reliant  we have said that we wont play on those termsseparately we are working with the city on a demand side deal

has asked that you attend this meeting with him  the ets presentation is from 230330
not surprising but thought you might be interested  i responded that letting go is a good thingbest
for clarity wherever you cite section 62 in your response i assume you mean section 63  your response does not address the key points upon which i based my interpretation of the plan  the beginning of section 63 states notwithstanding any other provision of the plan   this implies that section 63 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution  i disagree with your translation of a single sum distribution as meaning all at once instead of a single amount  i would like to meet to discuss or appeal to  w or  l   in addition your response does not address section 71  this appears to be the relevant section if the psa is to be paid in shares  additionally the q  a section in the plan brochure pg 8 works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value  this is the methodology described in section 71  and   share the above concerns  please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further
i would like to talk to you as soon as possible about my trading opportunities with aep  let me know if you have any time today or tomorrow  i am busy from 3pm to 6pm but available any other timethanks
in addition some of the numbers will need to be adjusted to reflect the actual closing date
here is some additional information since the circus closed down in sacramento on saturday morningthe senate adjourned early saturday morning closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary sessionthe assembly adjourned a few hours later closing the regular session but not the second extraordinary sessionthe legislatures options 1 the governor calls them back in two weeks they continue with the second extraordinary session and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till saturday morning2 the governor calls them back in two weeks the assembly ends the second extraordinary session they begin a third extraordinary session and the bills that were left hanging on saturday morning must start the process from scratch  however they can pass a waiver which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session and then pick up where they left off on saturday morning3 the governor calls them back in two weeks and the legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything ie the govenor can call them back but he cant make them votein short the legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they pleasewhere to from herethrough its actions on saturday morning the senate has sent a strong signal to  that the senate is not inclined to vote out an  bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last julyjust before closing down on saturday the senate also passed a resolution declaring that the condition of electric service in california no longer consitutes a sudden and severe energy shortage and that the state of emergency proclaimed by the governor on january 17 2001 is at and end  the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out   the assembly did not pass the resolution however  given the senates view and the open hositility between  and   only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the   bill  it is unclear at this time whether  would play it that toughwith the legislature gone the action turns to the puc where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday  we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended or at

fyi from penn state on the progress of the model to remove pcbs from transweterns pipeline
i know that sce is taking this position  they are simple wrong  unless and until we get all of our positive ctc back from the utility why should i even begin to consider their goofy arguments  in addition sce is receiving 33 b which is a full payment of all negative ctc  if their issue is to have a undercollection charge against all customers thats a different policy matter  the cpuc agreed to the idea of negative ctc and sce needs to pay  also if we are 5 of load and the undercollection is 33 b i think that sce would be looking for 165 mm  our entire claim  they arent talking about 5 from our view 150 mm claim

a few comments on the state of our var models the issues always become morecontroversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and i wouldlike to share with you a few observations1 critical importance of a  good risk management system to and the pe ratioa number of recent analysts reports characterized  as a hedge fund engaged inmassive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors one way to counter thiscrirticism is to emphasize the quality of s risk amnageemnt system andour strong risk amangeemnt culture  our claims regarding the strong risk managementtechnology and culture should be however supported  by realityit is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also canconvince the external parties stock analysts creditors  credit rating agencies aboutthe quality of our financial technology this can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology as we have done frequently in the pastby reality2 inputs from the trading desks vs historical calibrationthe var system used in  is based on the assumption that as much inputinformation as possible should come from the market ie trading desks or should be calibrated tothe market observations as opposed to historical dataone immediate improvement we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desksinformation and move if possible to replace them with market based forward looking dataone should not assume of course that the information coming from thetrading desks is perfect one problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnectbetween the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices curves the forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized forward price volatioty if this is not the case back testing for some portfolios will systematically fail one way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematicallyfwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements it will allow us to identify the source of problems we see in some books3 var process managementgiven the size of our trading operation we are running a var factorya system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolioswhat is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the qualityof the resultsspecifically i am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibilityfor the model calibration right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organizationand resides somewhere between

two items1  i spoke to  mckay about sumas  his views seem well thought out  he is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200000day of supply coming back by july 1st  see attached spreadsheet  in order to displace aeco gas coming down to kingsgate his target for sumas value is aeco 010  but since his forecast for aeco is that they will have 30 bcf left in storage at the end of march and current cash is trading down 070 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 050 he is expecting the aeco curve to widen to down 085  therefore his ultimate target for sumas is down 095 versus the current market of down 040his winter sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand see attached spreadsheet  sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers dont  support that premiumin conclusion i think i will sell some more summer sumas for my book 2  i will stay after the meeting to talk about  gs issues

the ferc is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules but ill answer in the context of the current rulesthere are three main principles behind the current rules1 pipeline cant share shipper information with affiliate2 pipeline cant share transportation info with affiliate  unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info and3 pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possiblethere is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately  for example pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate  wed argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better  but compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations  price terms etc  the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business  there was a real case to this effect  the pipeline  affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning  the pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting  ferc found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipelineso id say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to researchtraininghistorical type info but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions

on august 16 2001  counsel in dc requested that the  northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year  the data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for and for the most part s internal systems did not track the information in the format requested  since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money it was imperative that 1 the data be pulled together even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible 2 the data be as accurate as possible and 3 it be done in a very short period of timethe amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive  utilizing s comprehensive and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems we were able to accomplish this task  there were many instances where we hit a brick wall  specifically it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset although it was imperative we do so   was instrumental in bridging this gapas a result of her efforts we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in dc and subsequently for our ferc filing  i recommend that  receive a personal best award for the amount of 2000 crandall  is this good enough

why cant i consume alcohol on atkins you should not drink alcohol during induction but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the ongoing weight loss premaintenance and maintenance phases of the atkins nutritional approach when given the choice your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat but alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do alcohol consumption may also increase yeastrelated symptoms such as bloating gas and cravings for sweets and can therefore interfere with weight loss beer which contains yeast probably has the most yeastforming components of any alcohol an occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice scotch and other grainbased spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems note use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar seltzer club soda mineral water and nonaspartame diet sodas are better alternatives
 thanks for the update  have a safe and good trip  all the best
im big seller of interventions  they tend not to work  if the gas market wants to go lower enron coming out and buying 10000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down  maybe in the short term but thats it  same with currencies  ecb can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to euros but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point  i think it is more psychological than anything  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective

the senate rules committee just met  during the hearing senate leader   stated thatthe senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval sb78the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess  that bill was unacceptable to  and  which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday nightif the senate proceeds as  suggests the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get  signature generally sticks to his word but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb78 could squeak by however s comments in the rules committee certainly dont help 78s chances for survivalfinally the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage  more information on the windfall profits bill as we get itbest

greetings from londonwhat do you think about p tx dvn
i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here  still dont think this is equilibrium  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that weve moved down the demand curve  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target  market needs producer selling to get us through there  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett  hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here

i agree with  shelk to not attack the cbo reportwhile the cbo again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators may have withheld power the basic argument is that deregulation itself not fail rather it was never acheived   in addition the paper states that much of the blame for californias electricity crisis attaches to the states restructuring plan  but not to its objective electricity deregulationin addition californias response of directly intervening in the market  a response that could prove costly to electricity consumers and taxpayersi hope that we can use this to persuade ferc that they are missing the boat on the refund case  the cbo has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the states poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis  the cbo finds that wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated marketbecause features of the restructuring plan limited the responsiveness of the supply and demand sides of the electricity marketseems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out together with our details of the policy failures  this cbo report clearly undercuts the political arguments of the  administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible longterm contracts but has passed through 100 of the high costs to consumers

do the best we can  as enw we utilize the analyst pool much more heavily than the associates pool  several of us from enw nterviewed analyst candidates for fastastic friday on october 26 including me  i believe that we have a number of enw managers committed to the november 16 fantastic friday interviews for analysts  most associates rotations are commercial rotations so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the november 3 and december 1 super saturdays  what would be the time commitment on saturday

hi evieas you know  is being well  about just about everything at the puc  i think that we actually have some leverage with pge however  ive helped to broker a meeting between large customers and pge  botorff and   this friday at 130 pm after djs meeting  dj and delainey are organizing the basic idea is to see if there is some way to strike a reasonable deal on the dacost allocation issues with pge which could then be submitted to puc around  which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible at the first meeting we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1 what matters to people 2 where people on the issues and 3 pges willingness to deal  the goal is to find out if theres any room for a deal  should not take a long time i hope you can attend since the meeting will be significantly less productive if youre not there and who knows it may lead to something that permits us to go around   likely attendees are cmta cleca the chamber you hopefully pge and me    kahl be at djs meeting best

i think i could make a case for decreasing ecp because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ecp must run units for 6 hours etc   i would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at 100mwh   this forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatchwe have seen what the additional peakers in the east does to volatility and energy clearing prices in generalwhat are your thoughts

im surprised that under the circumstances american wont just do it   and i both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline continental for me and virgin for   of course in our cases the original flights were cancelled  i dont have the cunard reservations number here and havent been able to access the web site this afternoon  i will get it for you when i get home  the fax number for the guest relations department is 3054633030in a sense i felt safer in london than here  once we got off the qe2 we werent doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and i dont anticipate attacks against individual americans overseas  at least not outside of muslim countries  while there was an increase in police presence around town we didnt hear of any actual threats to americans while we were in london  airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further  the europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do  the sword rattling doesnt bother me too much  ive been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as youre in a friendly country it shouldnt be an issue  on the other hand it really feels good to be home and i can sure understand your wanting to have her with youfrom her point of view i think that while the brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive the tragedy just isnt as immediate there and so the impact on  has been somewhat less than if we had been home  given that i think she doesnt want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in europe while she has the chance and is already over there  for me i have to say it was hard to have any fun after tuesday noon although i tried to put a good face on it  i dont know when that will improve since im still pretty depressed  its probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than i am  the lawyer in me sees two sides a a trip to paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events

states electric  gets lighterenergy  and the puc clash over why only a fraction of the 20 reduction will be passed on to consumersby miguel bustillotimes staff writeroctober 20 2001sacramento  california now expects its electricity bill to be 20 less than estimated as recently as two months ago opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale the  administration said friday even so the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5 the administration added the discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between gov gray  and public utilities commission president  lynch administration officials said residential customers wont see much relief because recent actions by the puc have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation specifically officials said the puc erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the states powerbuying system and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans lynch disagrees on both points the real problem she said again friday is that california purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis the best way to save consumers money she suggested is to renegotiate the states energy contracts california has been purchasing massive quantities of power since january because the states large private utilities could no longer do so and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the states economy and endanger the public the utilities pacific gas  electric san  gas  electric and southern california  ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers in august state officials estimated the departments power costs for 2001 and 2002 the time the state plans to be in the power business at 2145 billion the new estimate released friday pares that figure to 172 billion but in what consumer groups angrily called a jailbreak  administration officials disclosed for the first time friday that large businesses fled the states powerbuying system en masse this summer opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the states power costs big businesses bail out leave tab to consumersthe puc announced in june that it was putting a lid on the socalled directaccess deals because

here are the examples we talked aboutassumptions1  eol and broker market  cob 30  402  we put out a cobmc market 4 at 73  in eol product 1  cob and product 2  mcheres what will happen in the broker marketa if someone hits my bid of 4 in the broker market i will buy cob at something like 35 and i will sell midc at 31b if someone lifts my offer of 7 in the broker market i will sell cob at something like 35 and i will buy midc at 28if you take the same assumptions and show this market on eol heres my understanding of what will happenc if someone hits my bid of 4 on eol i will sell cob at 35 and i will buy mc at 39 compare this with ad if someone lifts my offer of 7 on eol i will buy cob at 35 and i will sell mc at 42 compare this with bclearly this doesnt workone possible solution i think is to examine what happens if you put out a cobmc product on eol but switch the products such that product 1  mc and product 2  cob and assume we put the underlying product 1 market out as mc 30  40e  if someone hits my bid of 4 on eol i will sell mc at 35 and i will buy cob at 39 achieves same result as a which is what we wantf  if someone lifts my offer of 7 on eol i will buy mc at 35 and i will sell cob at 42 achieves the same result as b which is what we wanti realize e and f dont jive with our long contract description but conceptually it worksif you have any questions let me know

walters as californias malaise deepens gray  standing plummets published oct 7 2001 a year ago gray  was riding high  because californians were prosperous confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo  high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance or any personal affection among californians for their cool and distant governor he was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings today a dark cloud has descended on the state a sharp decline in the economy particularly hightech sectors a stubborn energy crisis and most recently the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of californiabound airliners have left californians worried about their personal safety and economic security and theyre looking for someone to blame  approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation and they have continued to sag thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for reelection in 13 months the seriousness of  decline was underscored late last month in a statewide field poll indicating that at the moment most california voters would prefer former los angeles mayor  riordan to  history indicates that  should still be favored to win a second term but if riordan does become the republican candidate he would have at least an outside chance of unseating   chief problem is that he will be running for reelection in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings state tax revenues are in a nosedive running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year and  will be compelled to make multibilliondollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups how big the state budget hole will become is anyones guess theres a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project some analysts believe that  problem could rival the 14 billion deficit that predecessor   confronted in 1991

thanks for your note  just so you have the whole picture  our analysis from a us law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades  the offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade  we have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade  this is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part  this happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed  can get you a copy if you want it  but when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake  under us law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed  in that case the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind  one alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customers completed transactions section as if it had never happened  as far as i know we have only had to do this once or twice

fyi  latest word is that assembly senate and administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until theyve struck a deal on the  mou  word on da is not good  thus far it appears that the puc study outlined in the letter from   co to lynch is as far as the senate wants to go at this time but folks continue to push  seems to be a possibility that if the legislature does reconvene there may be a push by green senators to pass a green only da billin addition lynch is setting the stage to have the puc reject the rate agreement between dwr and the puc on tuesday  this despite the governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners  despite the strong arm tactics it appears that brown may be the only aye vote at this pointthe idea is that if the puc votes down the rate agreement the only thing  will have left is 18xx  well report back with news as we get itbest
hi  all is well  congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the puc  must be a relief  i was writing to get your reaction to the judges proposed order in the el paso case  you think the commission is likely to adopt it  change it  judges proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue  appreciate your insightsand did you hear bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the commission at its 102501 meeting  what nextbest

the normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the executive committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an  vp  i assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process  i am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for vp based on the strength of an individuals resume  if everyone else agrees to the exception i wont be the one to hold this up but i dont necessarily agree with the exception being granted

i think there is a real possibility here  it would be extremely challenging commerciallyhow do we convince customers to participatetwo distinct areas  i existing portfolio of business and ii new businessnew business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money who would say no to a aaa credit  still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present separating them out as not netting with new tradesexisting business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money  they will want the improved credit  but how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate  this seem to me to be the biggest hurdleissuesrequires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contractsadequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participatemight make more sense where no current positions existcontract hurdlesneed to allow for termination by defaulting party so  vmac will be able to control termination on defaultneed the consent of counterparty to assign contract to vmacmay require changing permitted credit support from counterparties letters of credit probably dont workif we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure an initial chunk of money will have to be given to vmac to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio  how much is it and do we have that moneyits not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties  that is if we have given an aggregate 200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate 100 million credit line to in the money counterparties will vmac be satisfied with the mismatch   we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers  if we go to 100 collateral requirements for all participating transactions this is solved since there cant be a mismatch   customers agree to 100 collateral requirements  ie no credit linesonce the supportedparticipating portfolio is out of the money  will have to post collateral to vmac  if we fail vmac can default all participatingsupported contracts  when all of the contracts are terminated with  as the defaulting party the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market  presumably vmac will require

devises new borrowing plan his executive order could speed up 125 billion in bond sales and bypass puc oversight of repayment mechanism sacramento  gov gray  is crafting a new plan to expedite the longdelayed borrowing of 125 billion to repay the sagging california state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis the plan  which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week  would minimize the role of the states top power regulator the public utilities commission which enraged  last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan with enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two states largest utilities the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis that is one scenario  spokeswoman  mclean said wednesday when asked about the proposal there are a number of different scenarios being considered nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell 125 billion in revenue bonds most of which about 96 billion would go back into the state treasury the issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid  a critical step before they could be marketed to investors  wanted the puc to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers but the puc said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes the puc also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the controlled department of water resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue the puc which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority it rejected the  plan oct 2 on a 41 vote led by its president  appointee  lynch  earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market the plan now under review however would bypass that the dwr would not directly set rates but under the  plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming

state lowers estimate of energy costs consumers might see rates decrease  gledhill chronicle sacramento bureau saturday october 20 2001 2001 san  chronicle sacramento  the state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power  suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result officials of the department of water resources said the state will need 17 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002  about 20 percent less than previously estimated the agency began buying power on jan 17 when the states three investor owned utilities were no longer considered creditworthy at the time prices on the spot market reached upwards of 450 a megawatt hour now however prices average 30 a megawatt hour circumstances have changed said  nichols of navigant consulting which is a consultant to the department of water resources conservation has helped we think the dwr contracts have established reliability in the market we have broken the back of the spot market earlier this year the state signed 56 longterm contracts with various generators to purchase power those contracts which were inked when prices were at their peak have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the puc and gov gray  administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts but the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day the rest comes from the spot market  purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed prices on the spot market have dropped in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive it is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs if the projections hold the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue 125 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases at the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs they blasted the state public utilities commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers 8 billion administration officials and state treasurer  angelides said a puc decision to delay the suspension of direct access  the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power  will shift higher costs to smaller customers the puc proposed the ban on direct access

the blending vs nonblending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so i would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as i understand them  only the curves applicable to the east nerc regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility therefore no blending is needed for daily options they point directly to the daily vols or monthly options they point directly to the monthly vol  all curves applicable to the west nerc regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly therefore blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily optionsthe best rules to be in place for the blending vs nonblending would be based on curve  east curves do not blend  west curves do blend  therefore any daily or monthly option in the east would not have to blend  the potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that for example the east portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a west region curve and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the east portfoliooptions at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem  are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration  we still need to discuss thisi would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules  let me know

as most of you know nrgs proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut uis territory was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc   the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago   the proposed purchase price of 350 million for 1000 mw of coal was a bargain price at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct over the past 23 years the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they puked the plants to nrg for 350kw in early 2000   at a minimum it is expected that 100150kw of scr andor scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies my strong view is that as a practical matter the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct   the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect   the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area   in a true locational marginal price environment the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york   currently pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads regardless of who causes the congestion    in the recently proposed single ne rto model it is about 80 certain that the pjm locational marginal price market model will be implemented sometime between mid2003 and mid2004   at that point in time consumers in the congested areas of nepool incity boston and ct will be exposed to higher energy prices while consumers in maine new hampshire and rhode island should see lower prices given the facts above coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset node    if we could buy these plants for approx 250kw with 150kw of environmental

fyi  note below that even the mighty and powerful power authoritys own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short despite dwr contracts and da stampede which should leave one to believe that contrary to angelides letter the more the da the better which further supports  lynchs response to the angelides letter that da reduces the amount of spot power dwr has to buybestconsumer power and conservation financing authority pace of power authority renewable portfolio agenda is slowed quite possibly the most significant action taken at the october 19 consumer power and conservation financing authority power authority was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval the power authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible instead of approving a number of contracts on its october 19 agenda the power authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its november 2 meeting acknowledging that no action can be taken until the department of water resources dwr rate agreement stalemate has been resolved chairman  stated that the public utility commissions rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the power authority to exercise renewable contracts to contract for peaker generation andor to implement demand side programs the power authority relies upon dwrs credit to fund these programs and until a rate agreement is finalized the power authority cannot sign contracts  indicated that the power authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the central valley as well as 400 mw generated by wind with the current glut of contracts why do we need additional reserves kellan flukinger senior advisor to chairman  and  doll provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the power authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in longterm contracts there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the state flukinger concluded that the state still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to puc regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the state he believes that the shortterm contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to pricespikes and supply shortages he believes that

whatever babe  i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out  like you  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these like when i had chest pains the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable  you should do what you want to do but i guess what i am saying is that you are not going to die  so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem

not much i guess  im sure you heard the cnbc speel earlier  i have no news other than that
mckinsey  i read their letter  pretty good recap of where we are today   busby and i would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal tradeoffs relative to that  would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with mckinsey  what i know is that mckinsey can be very expensive to work with  we would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with mckinsey  staff meeting attendees    sommers now attend the thursday net works staff meeting  does he know about it for this week  have we made any decisions on the purpose and makeup of that meeting  we are including s directs on it but not their counter parts in operations  including operations would make that meeting too big so i am not necessarily suggesting that  just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have  fyi  in causeys staff meeting today  mentioned that the move of the isc under net works was announced within net works  and spread  before causey or  announced this to the people in the isc  creates a bit of a bumpy start  causey is still very much in favor of this move  he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired  i can share those with you  causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with  in agreeing to the transition  budgets  after meeting with whalley last week should we consider coming to the table as net works with a reduction in budgeted dollars expense and capital of 10 or so  that has not been our goal to date but maybe it should be given the stretch that  is trying to make  might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves  i have some ideas on how we might get there  let me know  we would need to get that done this week  
ok  this isnt dying  i understand all the usual problems but i am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis  west desk  baughman and vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow  slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate  is it purely staffing  can we help

  fyi re  fimat canada inc  i assume you have jury duty  call when you have a chance
alli am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power groupin the past we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth business day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month  as a practical matter calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last business day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swapshow do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month  is this a cash flow issue  do i need to involve someone from treasury or settlementsplease let me know  thanks

from the gas and power side we wouldnt need any traders in montreal but perhaps some marketers devries in toronto runs our eastern canada operation if you would like to talk to him
jeffis the problem that the energy dwr purchased is above market and not needed by core  or  just above market  if the energy is needed by core wouldnt the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and qf supply  if the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time  once again there would be a ctc type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered

fyi thought folks might be interested in the following story in addition ive attached at the end for those that are interested a csfb report on pges por announced yesterdayvery much enjoyed working with this group on a solution for california  perhaps given were things stand well have another shot at helping get the market california energy policy and  back on their feetbestferc to examine alleged market manipulation by calif isoupdated friday september 21 2001 0453 pm et by  leopold of dow jones newswireslos angeles dow jonesfederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained friday by dow jones newswires fridayat issue is whether the california independent system operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market the states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for gov gray  who signed 43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materializedthe federal energy regulatory commission will hold a meeting in california monday to address generators complaints the energy companies say that the california isos purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by  wolfman lead ferc counsel for market oversight and enforcementthe letter was sent to the iso the california department of water resources  which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midjanuary  and several generators all of which were to attend the meetingrecently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the california iso as they have had to change in the last nine months are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure wolfman said in her letter the purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the iso and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities cdwr on appropriate practices and proceduresiso procedures need explaining fercthe isos main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid as part of that job the iso determines which power plants to call into service

thanks for passing this message on  it is good to know what is on the rumor mill and nobody who knows what i do ever passes those on to me directlyi believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on midyear prc as that would not be the best legal defense to have   instead hr with assistance from legal has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees if any will be affected  listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors ability to perform several different types of jobs business knowledge leadership teamwork and historical performance over the last 18 months  prc results would not be the sole factor  otherwise someone who is the only person who knows how to do a missioncritical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at midyear review  that result obviously would be disasterous

responded and filled me in on the issue  sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems  how are we going to clean up the existing backlog  did you know that this had grown so large   says that this sits in  stubbs lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help sounds as if the offer has not been taken by    is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things  i hate getting these emails from him he always has more info than i do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me  i would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and i am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first  t worry  you are not alone in this  applies to ea egm and eim as well  lets talk about how we can manage this better

here are my thoughts  issues with the epsa paper1the epsa paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that ferc staff proposed  should epsa at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed  gives epsa an out of this recommendation if it proves later that fercs application of the delivered price test is unworkable2 i dont understand when epsa says our recommendation therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power on page 2 of the draft  why should epsa indicate that it is comfortable with a 20 economic capacity test to ferc  i would argue that 35 is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position  also is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in realtime  having a once and done for three year application is ok but if we are conditioned that we cant get beyond 20 in any market what does this do to trading and how would this be reported3  the discussion on available economic capacity and its implication for having a bias against new entry is confusing  maybe we should clairfy our concerns  4the argument that all new generation is by definition procompetitive needs to be strengthened  it should be explained in the context of the delivered price test  also it that still true if a party which holds 100 mw in a 500 mw market builds a 100 mw power plant  now 200 mw in a 500 mw market  maybe i am missing something5epsa needs to make the argument that conditioning mbr on vague rules is wrong and anticompetitive earlier in the paper  this is my biggest concern  that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market breaks even though our fundamental presence has not changed6i dont understand the epsa paper on rto versus nonrto markets  epsa endorses something but im not sure what  what does this mean if i sell on tvas network  i appreciate blanket authority but i wonder about exactly how this would be constructed  would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority  also doesnt this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who dont want competition  if they never set up an rto they never

would there be any interest in using the auction functions on eol for this product instead of a product line  there is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules  reserve prices or not sale commitment or not timing etc  and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them   i assume we are only showing one side of this market

helloyour right it has been a long time since we have chatted  things are a changen with my lifefirst i just got back from a little so called vacation where  and i drove from west palm beach to   we did it over 3 days so it wasnt that bad  day one was a 10 hour hop from west palm to desitn fl  you would have loved  they have the most amazing sand on their beaches  it kind of reminds me of icing sugar  very white and has a very fine texture and i felt like i was sink right into the sand wwwholidayinndestincom  next stop was in new orleans which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good cajun food  it took about 6 hrs to get there from  but the traffic was not that bad  next stop was in  about 55 hrs from new orleans  by now im sure you have asked yourselfwhy did they do this drive  and the obvious answer is because  is moving there  she rented a really nice loft in down town  not far from  field httpastrosmlbcomnasappmlbhouballparkhouballparkhistoryjsp  she took a job with  energy service which is our retail company  the bad thing is im not sure how i feel about having her work for the same company the good thing is that she is in a different building than the wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low  i guess this would kind of be like if we worked for shell and i ran the bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration  not the same business but nonetheless for the same companysecond  it look like i am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to  as well  believe it or not this was not by design just a mere coincident  however it has presented some tough questions  do i really want to move again and do i want to cohabitate  moving is the easy part im starting to become an expert and i was thinking about selling my house anyway  as for cohabitating the jury is still out   would have no problem with the idea but

we held a meeting to discuss the status of tws 637 imbalance filing  our current position after discussions about a month ago has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stirup segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie  we discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our oba wish list outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filingafter further discussion we decided that the one thing most narrowly defined that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cashout in constrained areas  if defined this narrowly this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data  we think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing   are going to discuss with mkm and teb with   lyn  terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe  to blanco blanco to thoreau thoreau to the border  check with  for any other areas that should be included and increased imbalance levels  we plan to get together next week to discuss furtherconcerning the rest of our oba wish list we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a settlement position on those issues to have ready in the event of commission action in this docket

couldnt another explanation be that the board did understand the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the chinese walls and protections were put in placei dont believe the board members would shirk their responsibilities as you pointed out most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals

i think the only other solution is to post two curves one with an sp and one with pr  you should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type pr and have it look to the sp curve   then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value just two different risk types  the only other option i see is to change the deals back to the old aeco curve that we used prior to this

 i am about to sell storage inventory and would like to know what if any federal tax liabilities we may havethanks
you asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance  the bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as followsprovided that  meets its earnings targets and provided that employee is rated within the top 25 of the performance criteria under s annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question employees annual bonus amounts under the plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively shall be based on an annual bonus target of this language does not address a persons performance as compared to ones peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25 of those criteria  thus if there are only 3 rating categories ie 1 2 3 distributed as 108010 then only the people in the top category would be within the top 2533 of the rating criteria  given the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25 of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was draftedas a result i would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories ie 2a 2b or 2c  that way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2a would be eligible for the target bonus  if there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high for those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 108010 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75 of the categories under that process  of course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc in this processplease let me know if you have any questions

understand   has been mans biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions  they approached us on wednesday to try to increase the margin required even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5 years ago  i refused to agree to change the margin calculations  it became clear that man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that man is a relatively small shop  i agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account  at the same time i told them i was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handledidnt want the clearing business i would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make  clear our business always or clear it never  paribas has stuck with us throughout and i intend to clear the majority of future biz with paribas  i agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday which we did but the rest of the position would stay there  they agreed  we specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time   them if they are trying to go back on that

greetings folks  the folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on  they understand as do we that the likelihood of prevailing is slim but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current da status and to attempt to preserve it going forward  da seems to need all the help it can muster given that  wood and  barnett appear to have control of the issue at the puc could you let me know either way if youll sign on   talked to  yesterday who said youd be making the call on this one  thanks a bunchbest
weve been experimenting with spreads on eol and i want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on eolassume you want to put out the cobmc spread 4 at 4  also assume cob is 275 at 300  as you know if you put this out in the broker market you would expect to buy cob 4 under midc or sell cob 4 overif you want to duplicate these trades on eol you could put out cobmc 4 at 4 but here is whats going to happen assume cob mid is 2875  if somebody hits your bid you will sell cob at 2875 and buy midc at 2835  if somebody lifts your offer you will buy  cob at 2875 and sell mc at 2915  effectively the eol transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid or the title is cobmc but the transaction is mccob  the problem it seems to me is that fundamentally bid is always first offer is second  for this to work as is the market would have to accept that in all cases bidoffer applies except with eol spreads where its offerbidthis seems too confusing to me  im not sure how you guys feel about  it but i want to give you a heads up

 etal  attached is the complaint that ees intends to file tomorrow against sce related to the recoupment of our negative ctc  as you aware after returning our customers to da recently our billing department was expecting that the past negative ctcs would be returned to our customers accounts  this has not happened nor after conversations with sce will it occur  this complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds  primarily ees does not want to pay for utility charges for our customers while an outstanding negative ctc balance is dueone key risk with filing this complaint is that sce may consolidate this case with the earlier complaint that is currently on hold  probably not too big of a downsidewe will be paying the bills into the cpuc for holding until the resolution of the complaintany questions or issues please let me know

fyinevada puc acts to change or void longterm pwr contracts los angeles dow jones the nevada public utilities commission wednesday voted to allow its general counsel office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate longterm electricity contracts entered into by the states two largest utilities a puc spokeswoman said the contracts would force  pacific resources srp utilities  pacific power co and nevada power co to pay a higher price for power than current market rates said  soderberg puc chairman we paid high prices when the prices were high but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous soderberg said no one at  pacific or nevada power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities or the value of the contracts the puc action follows a letter sent by gov  guinn to the federal energy regulatory commission in early october asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts the general counsels office will now have authority to file with ferc and in court to plead against the current contracts  pacific has said that a june ferc order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company  pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices the company has said as well if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market it will now receive less for that power under the cap it has said california s public utilities commission is also pushing for renegotiation of 43 billion in longterm contracts signed by the state which has been buying power on behalf of cashstrapped utilities since january

please forward along to others i may have missed but need to knowthe commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the da suspensionwith minor exceptions the utilities told the commission that the commission didnt need to conduct hearings and that the commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees  the utilities said that hearings could be held sometime later to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the px credit going forwarda large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearingsthere were lengthy arguments in front of the judge at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conferencethe next hearing will be on dec 12ththe judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last fridayin sum there will be another hearing on dec 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the commission making decisions on these issuesat this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearingsof particular note at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is not inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of direct access to july 1 and that he didnt think that the puc commissioner assigned to the case was either worried that he said too much he then said he couldntshouldnt spead for the commissionerthe judge and the commissioner who was at the hearing went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their da contracts to the puc as requested in the document the puc issued asking folks to submit comments on the issuesour attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1 the commission didnt need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2 the commission doesnt have the authority to ask to see contracts and they aint likely going to get them without a fight  though the probability many not be high there is at least the chance that the commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts  seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblityinterestingly

great trading asset but fixed costs are enormous   the entire value proposition is based upon 15mwh spread between peak and offpeak which is clearly there today    my view is this spread collapses over time due to dsmdgrealtime pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based marketswe should look at the asset but recognize the fixed costs are huge

the attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced southwest gas meter points off of el paso kern and pge  as i indicated earlier swg may have deliveries off of socal which we would not be able to see  also there may be unidentified swg meter points not included in the attached file and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher  finally if this data is used for pricinghedging analysis one should be careful which prices they use for comparison  swg territory in california would be subject to california pricing while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently  in addition southwest gas owns transport capacity on el paso such that they were really only vulnerable to san  or keystone price fluxuations and not socal  you could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity which i do not it is available on el pasos website  anyway thats all i have

we should get the focus off of micromanaging ferc  this isnt about a federal agency this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms  obviously our view is that fercs approach at least so far appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable secure and affordable power  i like the gerrymandering message  a process dependent on compromise eg a legislative body like congress is going to produce a camel and that wont work for customers  truth be told it was this same kind of compromised political consensusbuilding exercise which produced ab 1890 and the resulting debacle in californias energy market
my thoughts 1focus more on tariff standardization i think that this is the key issue for  because lmp based bid balancing market is almost a done deal  and the texas market seems to be fine for liquidity  build around a new proforma with a network plus model2i would highlight that size matters  redouble our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments3i would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no sourcesink requirement4the gas  power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration ie cng but because of the geographic reach  many ldcs used columbia pl but only one ldc uses aeps  the electric market needs transmission to be rationalized across the marketplace so moving power to where its needed from where its at5should we attack the 209 boards  agree that they are unnecessary but pls be carefulthanks

i checked with wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included  so that reduces some of the savings  either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to 20000 more for a 4000 sq ft home  even if i assume my energy savings will be 125month it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5 interest rate  cost is a major concern but i am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs  i am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do  what are some other alternatives that would also be effective  radiant barrier  more attic ventilation  thank you for your help

if you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at thompsonville with eex during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with aep done  i thought that there were some unique financing issues that required  to retain the transaction  it appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with hpl it should probably go with the sale  i just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep  whole  any thoughts
       negotiations with socal have gone nowhere  out of the 60m past and future in dispute they have only offered about 600000 in value  were taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west andor having them buy out of west texas lateral space which tk and  would sell for incremental revenue  if this doesnt prove fruitful then i would intend to pursue the ferc decision  agreed
i have taken no time off

i think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and i thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region  these relate to fixed price lock ins with peoples  i think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month  we will have to try and work on this for this month  the problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled  sorry for the confusion

hey not sure what you guys are up to likely making yourself pretty for potential investors  were not quite at that point yet here so things are very slow which has given me sometime to look into r been on my list for quite some time  it looks very good  have youhad a chance to look into it  id like to verify that its worth putting some time into  hope things are going well and ill give a call to chat sometime soon  cooper
teamwe now have the capability of importing live eol quotes into our models if so desired   tonks who supports it development efforts for the trading floor has made this capability available to us via a file that i have now saved in the models directory under the name eolproductlistenin order to run the file you will first need to run a program called tibco rendezvous client  you can run this program by going to the start menusystem utility applicationsinstallation and disk creationinstall tibco rendezvous client  you will have to reboot after installation is complete  after rebooting you can then open the program eol program listenthe program has 2 sheets 1 eol and 2 eolsearchsheet 1 eol is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an eol id number that you enter in column c in order to determine the correct eol id number you need to use sheet 2 eolsearch  on this sheet you can enter a search string in cell b1 and then hit the search macro  efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number  once you find your product id  you can enter it into sheet 1 eol and then hit the start button  you will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wisha word of caution  we will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used  for instance it has been brought to my attention that the product id s change each month as new prompt months roll on  thus the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right id  is linking up should always be verified especially on older files  nonetheless as we get comfortable with the tool i believe that it will provide some value on deals that require realtime pricing inputsplease let me know if you have any questionscomments  i can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishesthanks
so  heres the synopsis  everything is business as usual  we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100  we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours  its going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company
from a valuation standpoint i assume case 1 would give us the highest multiple  the issue is is it doable  we have achieved 600 million last year  also before we go further with project armstrong i would like to get whalley and dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal  lets suspend these discussions for the time being
lorelie attached is a price distribution table that is set up as a template for sppc power load as it relates to market prices  and load  as you can see this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down  the distribution  fixed price vs floating  may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today  relative to the historical numbers but those iterations can be made as requiredpls review and we can discuss at your conveniencealso as discussed i am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult  with that being said however i do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ena and sppc are both protected and i would like to pursue this with you one area that i would like to start with to have sppc sell ena physical gas  3000040000day against a physical gas daily related price  once i have accumulated a payables position we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contractspaper currently in place  i am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonestregards  tycholiz

yes it is irrelevant   now that we have competent risk managers making the decision they will know how to effectively hedge these deals   furthermore pricing is always available on demand   when each trader has 3040 products to manage in a volatile market they are not necessarily going to put 0310 for peak and offpeak in every regionit becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently
thanks a lot i received it

i am sorry about your loss mostly because those in the family of god hate to see pain hit a family member  even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations god is in control  its his promise that he will never leave us nor forsake us  that in itself is a real comfort and security knowing we have his eternal and loving spirit with us at all times  when you get some time read romans 828 and then meditate on it  so many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by him because he desires to conform us inito the image of his son sometimes he has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that he can fill us with blessings that glorify him once we make a heart commitment and his spirit sets up residence within us gods promise in romans is to work everything including a job loss to his glory  if we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary  i will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of gods work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto him in your  walk  i will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities when youre feeling down and discouraged drop me a line  sharing  with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations  in hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren  i would consider it an honor to hear form you againkeep the faith  its all we have

im sure that by now everyones seen the letter that angelides sent to  last friday  if you havent let me know and ill have it faxed to you  in short angelides blames all of the financial woes of the state on  and the puc  specifically he claims that by allowing da signups to extend to september 20th the puc may have shifted over 8 billion to homeowners small businesses and other enterprises  angelides ends the lettery by urging the commission to immediately roll back the da suspension date to july 1the concern of course is that angelides assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention ie direct access8 billion tax on homeowners  to her credit  refuted angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the dwr contracts  she also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the july 1september 20 suspension issue at the next commission meetingin light of these events and the increasing attacks on  by angelides and others in the administration it might be useful to give  an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her statingangelides is all wetda and fairness are not mutually exclusive and the puc has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward  thus the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basisrestating that the puc has no legal authority to retroactively suspend da to july 1 etc etcfolks may have other points to make  seems that wed want to keep the letter short and to the point however  a letter might be useful in order to 1 give  some support and 2 get some counterpress in response to the angelides tantrumany thoughts  best

commissioners  m duque and  a bilas dissentingone could say that this order is consistent with the administrations present third world country mentality we are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale marketwe are not convinced that the department of water resources dwr bond ratings depend on killing direct access  this notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds direct access should be seen as a benefit to dwr  it would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve dwr from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner something else is going on here we think that the dwr does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it will make dwrs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear the commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by dwr finance and the treasurer  instead the commission is making an ill informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later dwr and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if dwr is making prudent energy purchases only if dwrs contracts are too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices indeed retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on dwr to make more prudent purchases this is a very important consideration since ab 1x prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the dwr costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds if there is no yardstick how can anyone measure dwr performance the answer is one cant unless sb 18xx is signed into law  we think that additional review of these issues before suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in the long run for these reasons we must respectfully dissents henry m duque  s richard a bilas         m duque a bilas       commissioner   commissionerseptember 20 2001

  per our discussion attached are drafts of s master firm agreements  sorry for the delay    s preference would be to use these master instead of the gisb agreements for the firm deals  the firm gtc were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these masters in place  i did review the gisb we currently have in place with northern states power wi and mn  these agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached master  these masters should address the specific concerns included in your email1  the masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the gisb does2  the netting issue we need to address  the gisb dont have netting provisions but we dont use gisb for any firm deals over 1 month in term  i am not sure i understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting  these master contain netting provisions  lets discuss once you have reviewed the masters3  force majeure provisions are similar to the gtc   prefers a vary narrow definition of fm  we modify the gisb fm to reflect this with special provisions  if you could provide specific comments we can address your issues4  audit provisions are included in the masters5  any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this master  if you could provide specific language we can address this issueputting these master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient  please review and lets discuss and your earliest convenience  i can be reached at 713 8533512

i started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara  i dont think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months  i started comparing the bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc and fixed as much as i could for the east and west i just started on central but we should check this all again on monday  because of this we have not reported any prompt month physical value  the rates group hasnt been around to get the demand charges either  we should have everything clean to report it on mondaygoing forward i guess we need to show people how to check it correctlysee you on monday
  i reviewed the form provided  some comments1  generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper  from an ena upstream overall standpoint if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered payment noms etc  2  with respect to this form there are some conceptual issuesa  no specific measures of damages if the parties breachb  no detail on the type of gas being purchase ie wellhead pooling point firm interruptible  contract states that seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver and buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase we would have to tie this downc  nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed3  there are also some legal issues  state law arbitration etc indemnityin summary we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form  i dont know the dynamics of the relationship  are they insistent on using their paper
any progress getting us access to the fundy site we would really like to be able to look at the weather ect

it didnt occur to me until seeing s message that we might have a hole in communications with  being out on an extended basis  we should probably create a message on s phone that refers callers to someone else  ditto on email messages   does it make sense for that referral to be  or you or   others within our organization that may try to reach  could have questions about global databases projects that s group had been handling etc  i am not trying to put this off on you if you dont think it is appropriate  but  andor  came to mind as possible contacts  by copy to  i also wonder if we should review incoming emails that have come to  over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond  let me know what you think

sorry to cut the conversation short last night but frankly i was in tears and it didnt make sense to continue the conversation  certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel you should do what you think is best for you  we will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you   my reaction last night was simply shock because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit  and your lead in to the conversation with you know we are staying at a hotel was such a surprise  yes you stayed at a hotel when you were here for thanksgiving but that was with   brigeda  and  staying in our home as well  with just the two of you and since you had said nothing to the contrary i assumed that you would be in our home  what you couldnt know of course is the caring time that i have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend  but it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel  i had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet a real bed instead of just a frame i ironed sheets on sunday night something that i never do for us and have my framer on a tight turnaround on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room  certainly other guests can enjoy these things too but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit i have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel and again whatever is best for you  sounds as if we should make that the norm from this point forward and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone  i do hope that you can come in time for lunch on friday  i am planning to take the day off from work and the plan was that  would

what is the specific appeal of distressed debt if you are going to trade debt or equities gs is the place to be
heres our assessment of wrights performance in californiaon the plus sidehe is generally probusiness and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth eg he opposed the windfall profits and related billshe sided with the california assembly republicans to craft an alternative to the mou for  that included direct access as a core feature of any mouhis decision to work with the republicans helped move the political center of gravityalbeit marginallymore favorably toward direct access in californiaon the negative side in each and every case that  has had to make a choice between the market customers and competition on the one hand and the utility on the other he has never waivered in his decisionhe always put the utility firsthere are three examples and there are more  1 during this extraordinary session he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a stranded cost charge for utilities yet by most accounts californians have already paid off the utilties stranded costs  how many times must californians pay we worked with consumer and business groups to oppose the bill2in the alternative mou that  worked on with republicans the replicans told us that  insisted on suspending direct access until january 1 2003a demand that most believe originated with 3 sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and billing services  today this issue is less important to us but it was very important to us at the time and  remained unswervingly in the utilities camp despite our efforts this helps  if you need any other information just let me know  best

and philippehaving listened to the dealbench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with  i would like to propose the following with respect to dealbench and enrononline1 the most valuable pieces of business functionality dealbench has are the data rooms and auctions the first might have some going concern value but probably not much as intralinks the king only generates 10mm in revs per year the second auctions while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business2 the technology as a whole is not severable right now and probably not ready for prime time thus the chances of getting a bid for it as ipr that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal we have some knowledge of this from our offline experiencesrecommendationenrononlines auction functionality is very thin dealbenchs has a lot of good business logic built into it while the code might not be up to our standards it would be of value to integrate it into the enrononline platform this way we take advantage of the superior enrononline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned there will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the dealbench auctions piece to accommodate the single enrononline login as well as change the look and feel to an enrononline one but this should be well worth it it is my strong belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that enrononline should own as a part of this move we should redeploy dealbenchs auction marketing force to attack this space which furthers the general commercial goals of ene as opposed to something that now is fringe at bestthanks

in addition make sure we understand the steam obligation and its effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate  it appears the 8000 heat rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate   solar turbines in combined cycle without a steam sale credit would usually have a heat rate around 10000 btukwhthe lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam which means less dispatch flexibility and producing offpeak energy at a lossmake sure we are modeling these dynamics properly
