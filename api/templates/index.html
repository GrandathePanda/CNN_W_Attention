    <h1> Who wrote it? </h1>
    <div class='directions'>
    <p> Below is a file drop area where you can upload training data to be used by a neural network
    for the purpose of learning which author wrote a certain piece of text. All you need to do it prepare a JSON file with
    a certain structure, upload it here and click train. When the model is done training we will display the id of the model here.
    Continue reading to understand the purpose of that ID.
    </p>
    <p> Alternatively you can provide a JSON file with an ID of an already trained model and a sample of text and we will use it to predict which
    author from the model's training data we think has written your sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSON structure for training is { dataset: { x: [[INTEGERS]], y: [STRING] }, n_authors: INTEGER, vocab_size: INTEGER, input_shape: INTEGER }
      <ol>
        <li>x is a list of a list of integers that represent your text samples with their words replace by the integer that represents their index in your vocabulary list</li>
        <li>y is a list of strings, which is the author as the index in your list of authors.</li>
        <li>vocab_size is an integer representing how many distinct words your training set has.</li>
        <li>n_authors is an integer that is the total number of authors your sample size contains</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSON structure for prediction is { model_id: UUID, sample: [INTEGER] }
      <ol>
        <li>model_id is the id returned from the training operation.</li>
        <li>sample is the text sample you want classified, it is in the same format as the individiual training samples from above.</li>
      </ol>
